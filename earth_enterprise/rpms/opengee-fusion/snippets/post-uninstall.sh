# Main Function
#-----------------------------------------------------------------

# On Red Hat the first argument to install scripts is "the number of versions
# of the package that are installed".  It is 0 when uninstalling the last
# version, 1 on first install, 2 or higher on upgrade.
#     On Debian systems the first parameter is "upgrade", "remove" or "purge".
# (See <https://wiki.debian.org/MaintainerScripts>.)
if [ "$1" = "0" ] || [ "$1" = "purge" ] ; then
