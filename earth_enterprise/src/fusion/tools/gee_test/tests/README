All python files in this directory will be run as tests. Each test can assume that the tutorial databases have been built and published. A test should output "SUCCESS" as its final line if it passes. All tests at this level should run without command line arguments. Tests that require command line arguments should be nested into directories here and then called with the appropriate arguments from a test here. If a test fails, it should be easy for the tester to re-run the test at lower and lower levels to help them isolate the problem.

Tests will be loaded from cns base on the tests_sets list in GetTests in gee_test.py. Test sets should be world readable tarballs that extract to the directory test_set. All items in the extracted test_set directory will be moved to tests, so any files at the top level ending in .py will be executed as tests. Currently, we get all test sets before we execute them, so some care must be taken to protect file name collisions.
