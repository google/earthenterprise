All python files in this directory will be run as tests. Each test can assume that the tutorial databases have been built and published. A test should output "SUCCESS" as its final line if it passes. All tests at this level should run without command line arguments. Tests that require command line arguments should be nested into directories here and then called with the appropriate arguments from a test here. If a test fails, it should be easy for the tester to re-run the test at lower and lower levels to help them isolate the problem.

This directory is meant for exploring new tests. Well-established tests should be put into tarballs and moved into the test_sets directory. These should also be stored in cns.
