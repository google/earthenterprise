# Wms-plate-carree-as-Mercator-tile error measurement tool.
#
# Tool for showing the pixel errors associated with serving plate
# carree tiles as Mercator tiles if the tile northern and southern
# boundaries match those of the Mercator tile that they are impersonating.
# Plate carree tiles with Mercator bounds are typically requested
# from wms for linear sampling of the plate carree map being served.
#
# In short, it demonstrates for latitudes near the equator at low
# LODs, and for latitudes further from the equator at higher LODs,
# the errors become very small (less than 1 pixel), which is probably
# better than errors within the imagery itself.
#
# Typically, we measure error at the center of the tile, which is not
# the exact position of maximum error, but close enough.
#
# E.g.
# LOD 4
#   Tile at 0.0 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 2.41357 pixels
#   Tile at 21.9 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 6.59861 pixels
#   Tile at 41.0 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 9.41641 pixels
# LOD 6
#   Tile at 0.0 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 0.15400 pixels
#   Tile at 21.9 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 1.30346 pixels
#   Tile at 41.0 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 2.14443 pixels
# LOD 8
#   Tile at 0.0 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 0.00964 pixels
#   Tile at 21.9 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 0.30174 pixels
#   Tile at 41.0 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 0.52049 pixels
#   Tile at 82.7 degrees
#     Error at 0.50: 0.77914 pixels
