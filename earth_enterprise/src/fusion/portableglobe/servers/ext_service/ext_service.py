"""Service for serving requests to /ext/... path.

The service defines three methods: SetWorkingDirectory,
ExtGetHandler, and ExtPostHandler.

SetWorkingDirectory sets the directory where this file is located and allows
the service to easily find external files that it may want to use to respond
to requests.

ExtGetHandler handles a GET request to the /ext/... pathway. Arguments for
the request are passed in via the handler object. The relative path
after "/ext/" is also passed in as a parameter.

ExtGetHandler handles a POST request to the /ext/... pathway. Arguments for
the request are passed in via the handler object. The relative path
after "/ext/" is also passed in as a parameter.
