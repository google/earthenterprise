# Quick and dirty tool to check data and quadtree bundles before
# they are packed into a glb.  It checks that the crc for each
# bundle, which is kept in a side file, matches the crc it calculates
# for each bundle. It also checks that number of packed data packets
# jibes with the index size. The crc is maintained in memory while
# the data and qtp bundles are generated, so if there is a mismatch
# between what is loaded to be written and what is actually written,
# it should appear as a crc error.
#
# Takes as arguments the path to the globe directory (should
# contain "data" and "qtp" directories) and the number of imagery,
# terrain, and vector packets (top line of output from
# geportableglobebuilder).
