Build Info:
For Fusion 3.2 and earlier, we build gdal-ge-1.4.2-2.x86_64.rpm which is a
sandboxed version of gdal.
A development RPM is built as well, necessary for build/dev machines to compile
against.

As of 2008-10-23:
gdal-ge-1.4.2-2.x86_64.rpm was built using rpmbuild gdal-ge.spec
on a SLES 9 box (compatible with SLES 9,10, RHEL 4,5 and Ubuntu 6,8)

To Build, you will need to build on a SLES 9 box using the scripts found in
//depot/googleclient/geo/fusion/RPMS/build_scripts

To build GDAL with MrSID Raster Format, MrSID library needs to be installed on your platform:
1- Get MrSID Decoding SDK library
2- Copy MrSDK library into a folder. Ex: \opt
3- Ensure that 'libltidsdk.so' can be disovered by 'ldconfig' command:
	3.1- Add the full path of 'libltidsdk.so' to ‘/etc/ld.so.conf’. You can edit that file as root admin only.
	3.2- Rebuild the libraries path cache (‘/etc/ld.so.cache’): $sudo ldconfig
	3.2- Verify that 'ldconfig' command can now detect 'libltidsdk.so' library: $ldconfig -p | grep libltidsdk.so
