# This script creates archive files that can be distributed as a release. The

# archives that we can publish on the GitHub releases page.

# this script downloads and packages a large repo it may take a long time to
# run.

# Example usage: to create archives for 5.2.0 (which is on the release_5.2.0)
# branch, run
# ./build_release_archive.sh release_5.2.0
