Hello Open GEE Community!
 
We are happy to announce the official release of Open GEE 5.3.0!  This release updates Open GEE with minor enhancements and bug fixes for GEE Fusion and Server.
 
**Performance and memory enhancements includes:**

**- The ability to control the XML cache size.** The size can be modified by configuring the _INIT_HEAP_SIZE_, _MAX_HEAP_SIZE_, and _BLOCK_SIZE_ settings in _/etc/opt/google/XMLparams_. This file must be created manually. View the [Configure Fusion performance document](http://www.opengee.org/geedocs/5.3.0/answer/176738.html) for more details.

**- The capability of purging periodically the XML cache .** This can be done by configuring the PURGE and PURGE_LEVEL settings in /etc/opt/google/XMLparams. This file must be created manually. The details are explained in the [Configure Fusion performance document](http://www.opengee.org/geedocs/5.3.0/answer/176738.html).

**Build enhancement:**

**- Option to pass long_version parameter to the SCons OpenGEE build.** This enable one to override the long version string.
