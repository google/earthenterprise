Hi Everyone!

We are pleased to announce the release Open GEE 5.2.1! This is a comprehensive update of Open GEE 5.2.0. It contains new features, several bug fixes in Fusion and GEE Server,
and updates to third-party libraries. Some of the new features include:

**MrSID support**: At build time, Open GEE checks for MrSID libraries and, if found, Fusion will be built with MrSID raster format support.

**RPM Installers**: For RedHat and CentOS, RPMs can now be built to provide easier installation. For Ubuntu, the installer scripts continue to be the supported method to install Open GEE.

**JPEG2000 performance boost**: Updated version of OpenJPEG2000 library has considerable performance increase.

**Controlling quality of terrain.**: Command-line tool gepackgen producing packets now accepts a decimation value. In general, reducing the decimation value for terrain produces higher-quality and better-looking terrain.

**Testing scripts enhanced**: <code>publish_tutorial.sh</code> and <code>publish_historical.sh</code> scripts now publish the pushed databases.

**Detailed version info**: Version number displayed in user interface shows detailed information indicating an official release or a development build.

**Continuous Integration**: Travis CI is used for continuous integration. On every new commit to Open GEE a build is executed to validate the committed changes.
