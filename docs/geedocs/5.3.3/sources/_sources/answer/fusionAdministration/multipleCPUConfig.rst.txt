Running Fusion on a Machine with Multiple CPUs

Fusion can be configured to use a maximum number of CPUs on a machine
with the following command:

"/opt/google/bin/geselectassetroot --assetroot /my/assetroot --numcpus
X" This number will show up as the maxjobs entry within getop output
and corresponds to how many concurrent jobs Fusion may spawn at any
one time. Note that the value for --numcpus should be equal to, or
less than, the number of physical CPU cores on the machine.

Each task within Fusion is configured to use 1 CPU by default.
Changing the maximum number of CPUs using the above command will not
affect the number of CPUs assigned to each individual task. Some tasks
in Fusion are capable of multithreaded support including:

gepackgen (imagery and terrain projects)

gemaptilegen (2D vector-based map tiles)

gecombineterrain (3D databases)

These tasks may be multithreaded by enabling

task rules

 within Fusion. Implementation of task rules is described in more
detail in

Configure Fusion performance

.

The

ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule

,

TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule

,

MapLayerLevel.taskrule

, and

CombinedTerrain.taskrule

 task rules enable multiple CPUs to work on each individual task. For
example, configuring a "minNumCPUs" and "maxNumCPUs" of two for the

ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule

 means that up to four gepackgen processes may run on Fusion when
eight CPU cores are allocated.

As a best practice,

ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule

,

TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule

 and

MapLayerLevel.taskrule

 should be configured such that multiple gepackgen and gemaptilegen
processes can run concurrently.

Since "gecombineterrain" is CPU-intensive and can be an operational
bottleneck, more CPUs should be assigned to that task to expedite
processing. So on a machine with

eight

 CPU cores available for Fusion processing:

Set /opt/google/bin/geselectassetroot --assetroot /my/assetroot
--numcpus=7. It's recommended to set the maximum number of CPUs
allocated to Fusion to (N-1), such that one CPU core is reserved for
system operations.

Set minNumCPU=2 and maxNumCPU=2 in ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule for
imagery projects (three concurrent gepackgen tasks possible).**

Set minNumCPU=3 and maxNumCPU=4 in TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule for
terrain projects (two concurrent gepackgen tasks possible)**

Set minNumCPU=3 and maxNumCPU=4 in MapLayerLevel.taskrule (two
concurrent gemaptilegen jobs possible).

Set minNumCPU=7 and maxNumCPU=7 in CombinedTerrain.taskrule (one
gecombineterrain task)  Fusion will use up to 200% CPU processing for
imagery projects per gepackgen process, and up to 400% CPU processing
for terrain projects. There is fundamentally a balance between
assigning sufficient numbers of CPUs to each individual process for
gepackgen while still enabling multiple concurrent gepackgen processes
for parallel processing.  All other tasks in Fusion will continue to
operate with min/max one CPU.
