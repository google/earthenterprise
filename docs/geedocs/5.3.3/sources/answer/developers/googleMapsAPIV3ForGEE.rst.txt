-[ Overview ]-

The

Google Maps JavaScript API V3

 is bundled with Google Earth Enterprise (GEE) Server and, for offline
use, with Portable Server. As of November 2015, Google Maps JavaScript
API v3.20 is bundled with GEE v5.1.2, but the API is updated
periodically to align with the Release version.

The bundled offline Google Maps JavaScript API is the same core
JavaScript V3 API supporting:

Events: Listening to click, mouseover

Controls: Built-in zoom, pan, scale + custom controls

Overlays: Symbols, markers, polylines

However there are some differences:

Method of invoking the API from a GEE or Portable Server to load in a
web page.

geeCreateFusionMap is a factory used to create instances of the
google.maps.Map class.

No support for objects that require access to online Google services:
Geocoding (google.maps.Geocoder)  Directions (google.maps.Directions)
StreetView (google.maps.StreetViewPanorama)  Traffic
(google.maps.TrafficLayer)  Places API, Distance Matrix, Wikipedia,
Panaramio, Weather layer, etc.

-[ Using the Fusion Maps API ]-

The Fusion Maps API is used to create and interact with map layers
created in Google Earth Enterprise. The API is based on the Google
Maps API but includes "geeCreateFusionMap", which makes it easier to
interact with map layers generated by Google Earth Enterprise.
Essentially, "geeCreateFusionMap" is a factory used to create
instances of the "google.maps.Map" class in which the GEE-specific
configuration options can be added as Method extensions.

The following code snippet is a

Hello World

 example of using "geeCreateFusionMap" to load a map:

   <html>
      <head>
         <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
         <style type="text/css">
            html { height: 100% }
            body { height: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px }
            #map_canvas { height: 100% }
         </style>
         <title>Hello World - GEE 2D Map Example</title>

         <!-- Start by defining GEE_BASE_URL. -->
         <script type="text/javascript">
            var GEE_BASE_URL = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.host;
         </script>

         <!-- Include the provided Maps API v3 files.  Located in /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps/api/ -->
            <script type="text/javascript" src="/maps/api/bootstrap.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript"
            src="/maps/api/fusion_extended_map.js"></script>

            <!-- geeServerDefs must be defined with the following script; insert name of your published 2D database -->
            <script type="text/javascript" src="/YourPublishedDatabase/query?request=Json&var=geeServerDefs"></script>

            <script type="text/javascript">
               function initialize() {
                  var myOptions = {
                     center: new google.maps.LatLng(-34.397, 150.644), zoom: 8
                     };
               var geemap = new geeCreateFusionMap("map_canvas", geeServerDefs, myOptions);
               }
            </script>

         </head>
         <body onload="initialize()">
            <!-- Be sure there is an element on the page with the id you specified above (map_canvas in this case). -->
            <div id="map_canvas" style="width:100%; height:100%"></div>
         </body>
      </html>

-[ Factory geeCreateFusionMap ]-

Use of the factory "geeCreateFusionMap" is distinct from the standard
Google Maps JavaScript API usage in the following ways:

Instantiate geeCreateFusionMap in order to create a Fusion map. This
is a factory for an extended version of the Maps API v3
google.maps.Map class, and the other methods are the extensions to
that class.

Use geeCreateFusionMap class instead of google.maps.Map to create
applications that use layers from GME or GEE.

geeCreateFusionMap(container, opts?) creates a new map inside the
given HTML container, typically a DIV element. Options are the same as
those of google.maps.Map

If a map type is passed into the options, GEE Server will override
these if an imagery layer is included in the Fusion Maps Database.

The path and location of the new map is serverURL/default_map, for
example, http://my_host_name/default_map.

-[ Factory geeCreateFusionMap Description ]-

The "Factory" and "Method extensions" are described in the following
tables.

-[ Factory ]-

    Factoryclass  Description  geeCreateFusionMap(container, opts?)
Creates a new Fusion map inside of the given HTML container, which is
typically a DIV element. The options are the same as the options for
google.maps.Map. However, if a map type is passed in to the options,
the Fusion maps server will override these if an imagery layer is
included in the Fusion Maps Database. After this constructor is
invoked, the setCenter() method should be called before any methods
that display Fusion layers on top of the map.

-[ Method extensions ]-

"geeCreateFusionMap" Method extensions are extensions of the Google
Maps API v3 "google.maps.Map" class.

      Method extensions  Return Value  Description
showInitialFusionLayers()  None  Show all layers that are enabled by
default. This method should only be invoked after the setCenter().
getFusionLayerCount()  Number  Returns the number of Fusion map
layers. This does not include the base imagery layer, which is built
as a custom map type and serves as the background of the map.
isFusionLayerVisible(index)  Boolean  Returns true if the layer is
currently shown on the map and false if it is hidden.
showFusionLayer(index)  None  Shows a previously hidden Fusion map
layer. This method should only be invoked after the setCenter() method
has been called to initially draw the map.  hideFusionLayer(index)
None  Hides the specified Fusion map layer.  getFusionLayerName(index)
String  Returns the name of the specified layer.
getFusionLayerIcon(index)  String  Returns the URL of the icon
associated with the specified layer.

-[ Examples ]-

Several examples that illustrate how to use the Fusion Maps API are
installed by default. You can find these examples in:

"/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps"

The following files are used by default for a published database. For
example, when serving "http://your-host.com/YourPublishedDatabase",
this code is used to render the page.

maps_local.html

maps_google.html

The following files provide basic examples of initializing a Fusion
Map. You can use them as templates but you will need to edit them with
the target path of a published 2D database to correctly initialize a
map in the browser.

example_google.html

example_local.html

-[ KML Support ]-

The "KMLLayer" object in the Google Maps JavaScript API is unavailable
in GEE since KML rendering is performed server-side and requires a
connection to google.com. As a workaround, you can overlay KML data on
your 2D Map using the

GeoXml

 parser extension for Google Maps.

The following steps are needed to utilize the GeoXml library with 2D
maps hosted on a Google Earth Enterprise Server:

Download the GeoXml library to your GEE Server. geoxmlfull_v3.js is
the main file to download.

Store the GeoXml library in the GEE Server Apache Document root.
Default location is /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/js

Load the GeoXml library in your GEE 2D Map HTML file:  <script
type="text/javascript" src="/js/geoxmlfull_v3.js"></script>

Store the target KML file in the GEE Server Apache Document root.

Create a GeoXml object in the GEE 2D Map HTML file to load your KML
file. Refer to GeoXml-specific methods and options.

See GeoXml

samples

.

Note:

  Performance may degrade with large KML files.

  GeoXml is an open-source package, not supported by Google.
