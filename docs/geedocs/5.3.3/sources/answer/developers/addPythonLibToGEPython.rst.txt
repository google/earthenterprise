Add Python Libraries to GEE Python

GEE uses system Python with some extra libraries to support
functionality such as publishing and custom search plug-ins.

Additional modules specific to GEE are installed in:

"/opt/google/gepython/Python-2.7.x/lib/python2.7/site-packages" ,
where x is determined by the system Python version.

psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter

google/protobuf is Google's serialization mechanism for structured
data.

mgrs provides conversion to and from MGRS

GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) Python library

-[ Add a Python library ]-

You can add a Python library to either the system Python path, or to
the "/opt/google/gepython/Python-2.7.x" path for it to be enabled with
GEE. One of the easiest ways to install a Python library is to use the
Python package tool, "pip". You may also need to consider any other
dependencies for your newly installed library.
