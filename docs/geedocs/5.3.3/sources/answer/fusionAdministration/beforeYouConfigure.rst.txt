Before you Configure Google Earth Enterprise Fusion

Before you use many of the Google Earth Enterprise Fusion
configuration tools, you must stop the system manager and then start
it after you change the configuration. To stop/start the system
manager, enter:

"/etc/init.d/gefusion [stop | start | restart]"
