Dynamically adjusting logging levels

In some instances, it may be desirable to change the logging level of
gesystemmanager dynamically during execution. The log level can be set
in "/etc/opt/google/systemrc" with the "<logLevel>" tag. Accetable
values range from 0-7, with 7 corresponding to the highest level. When
gesystemmanager loads, it will give preference to the "KH_NFY_LEVEL"
environment variable. To dynamically reload the systemrc file:
"/etc/init.d/gefusion reload"
