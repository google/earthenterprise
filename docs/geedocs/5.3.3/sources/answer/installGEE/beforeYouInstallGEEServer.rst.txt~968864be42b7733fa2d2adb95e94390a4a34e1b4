      Before installing Google Earth Enterprise (GEE) Server, you must
      configure your hardware, network, and GEE users. You should also
      carefully decide in advance where you want to store Fusion
      data and where you want to publish Fusion databases. You must
      provide this information during installation. The following
      sections provide information about GEE requirements,
      considerations, and best practices. Be sure to complete all of the
      tasks described in these sections before installing GEE Server.

      .. rubric:: Upgrading

      To prevent compatibility issues, you must run the same version of
      GEE Server and Fusion. If you upgrade Fusion without upgrading GEE
      Server, you will not be able to publish to the GEE Server database.

      .. rubric:: Configuring Your Host Volumes

      The best practices for naming your host volumes are:

      -  **Network naming convention**. You should use a network naming
         convention for any new volume that hosts Fusion or source data,
         whether it is initially part of a network or not, because you
         will almost certainly migrate to a network-based configuration
         eventually. Fusion requires both a network path and local name
         to resolve the locations of source files and related Fusion
         data, so changing the host volume name or path invalidates
         Fusion data. On a single workstation setup, the local and
         network paths are identical, but on a network-based
         configuration they are not.
      -  **/gevol**. You should use /``gevol`` as your volume naming
         convention because it is unlikely to conflict with standard
         Linux volume definitions. Linux systems frequently use either
         ``/vol(*)`` or ``/``\ ``data(*)`` as the local volume
         definition on a new system, so using this convention for Fusion
         can cause name conflicts if you later switch from a single
         workstation to a network-based configuration. For example, if
         you initially define ``/vol1/assets`` as the network location
         for a Fusion *asset root*, and you later add another
         workstation that has a local volume called ``/vol1``, that
         workstation cannot reference ``/vol1/assets``\ through the
         network because of the name conflict with its local volume
         definition. (See :ref:`Planning the Location of Your Asset Root <Planning_Location_Asset_Root_GEE>` for
         more information about the asset root.) You can avoid this
         conflict by using a unique naming convention for all volumes
         on your network (such as /``vol1``... /``vol``\ *n*), but
         /``gevol`` is a good choice because it is descriptive.

      .. rubric:: Configuring Multiple Storage Devices

      GEE Server and the Fusion asset root, source volumes, and publish
      root require large amounts of disk storage space. Fusion requires
      about three times as much storage space as GEE Server. The storage
      space can be either in the form of internal disks, directly
      attached storage devices, network-attached storage (NAS) devices,
      or storage area network (SAN) devices. Typically, these devices
      are configured into redundant arrays of independent disks (RAIDs)
      and presented to the operating system as volumes. Volumes can
      range in size from several hundred gigabytes to tens of
      terabytes.

      The difference between configuring a workstation with one, two, or
      three volumes is how you define the mount point for the source and
      asset volumes.

      When configuring a Linux workstation, it is best practice to use
      the following mount point naming conventions:

      -  **Single volume**

         Mount the single drive to slash (/). All data
         (``/gevol/assets``, ``/gevol/src``, and
         ``/gevol/published_dbs``) resides on that drive with the local
         path defined using the /``gevol`` naming convention.

      -  **Two volumes - a small system volume and a larger data
         volume**

         Mount the small system drive to slash (``/``). Mount the larger
         data drive to ``/gevol/``. Source and asset data volumes can
         then be defined as ``/gevol/assets`` and ``/gevol/src``.

      -  **Three volumes - a small system volume and two larger data
         volumes**

         Mount the small system drive to slash (``/``). Mount the first
         large data drive to ``/gevol/assets``. Mount the second large
         data drive to ``/gevol/src``.

      -  **More than three volumes**

         There are several strategies for storing very large data sets.
         Fusion can read from and write to multiple volumes. For more
         information, you can request help on our `Slack
         channel <http://slack.opengee.org/>`_.

      It is also important to keep internal and external storage devices
      separated so that if your internal server goes down, it does not
      affect your ability to serve published data to external clients.
      Likewise, if your external server goes down, you can replace it
      and publish from the internal storage device. Perhaps more
      importantly, keeping your internal and external storage devices
      separate reduces the possibility of performance problems that
      could occur if you are building a large data set or if a client
      requests a time-consuming search.

      .. rubric:: Planning the Location of Your Publish Root

      During GEE Server installation, you must specify a volume for the
      *publish root*. The publish root is the directory in which all of
      your published databases are stored.

      **If you specify a different volume than the asset root**:

      Whenever you publish a database, Fusion registers the database on
      the specified volume and then copies all of the database files to
      the designated volume.

      For example, if you specify ``/gevol/assets`` for your asset root
      and ``/data1/published_dbs`` for your publish root, whenever you
      publish a database, Fusion copies all of the database files from
      ``/gevol/assets`` to ``/data1/published_dbs`` (unless you allow
      symbolic links during installation). Copying takes more time as
      well as extra disk space.

      **If you specify the same volume as the asset root**:

      Whenever you publish a database, Fusion registers the database on
      the specified volume and sets symbolic links to the database
      files.

      For example, if you specify ``/gevol/assets`` for your asset root
      and ``/gevol/published_dbs`` for your publish root, whenever you
      publish a database, Fusion registers the database on ``gevol`` and
      sets hard links to the database files. No copying is necessary.

      .. rubric:: Setting Up GEE Users

      The GEE installer automatically configures certain system users to
      perform background tasks at the system level. If you accept the
      default user names and allow the installer to create those users
      on your local workstation, you are implementing local
      authentication only. Local authentication is designed for
      standalone workstations only.

      If you are using GEE over a network with at least two
      workstations, storage devices, or servers, the best practice is to
      use a centralized network authentication system such as LDAP, NIS,
      or one of the many commercially available systems.

      If you use a centralized network authentication system, you must
      add the following users to your authentication systemâ€™s user list:

      -  **gefusionuser**
      -  **geapacheuser**
      -  **gepguser**

      The primary group for all of these users is **gegroup**.

      If you are in a multi-user environment in which multiple
      workstations share a common asset root on a NAS/SAN, **these users
      must have the same UID on all devices, so you must assign them
      explicitly in both your network authentication system and in
      GEE**.

      Be sure to configure each GEE workstation, storage device, and GEE
      Server to use your network authentication system. For more
      information, see your network authentication system documentation.

      .. rubric:: Customizing GEE User Names

      You can use customized user and group names when installing
      Fusion. Specify the custom user and group names via the ``-u`` and
      ``-g`` options when running the installer. The GEE Server
      installer does not currently provide the option to customize user
      and group names.

      .. rubric:: Deciding Which Products To Install

      You do not need to install all products on all devices. Follow the
      guidelines below.

      **Development machine**:

      -  Install both Fusion and GEE Server on the server machine that
         you want to use to import your source GIS data and create
         flyable 3D and 2D databases. A system in this configuration is
         typically called the "development machine" since its primary
         task is to build flyable databases and only a small number of
         users will view the flyable data for quality assurance testing.
      -  Install the Fusion tutorial files on the "development machine"
         for users who are new to Fusion or to this version of Fusion.
         You can also use the Fusion tutorial files to test publishing.

      **Production machine**:

      -  Install only the GEE Server on the server machine that hosts
         flyable 3D and 2D databases. All authorized end-users will
         connect to this system -- typically referred to as the
         "production machine" -- to view the flyable databases. This
         machine must be accessible through the network from the
         development machine in order to publish databases.
      -  Users who will not have direct network access to their
         production machines, or users who plan to update remote systems
         with external hard drives, must also install the "Disconnected
         Publishing Add-on" for additional tools.
