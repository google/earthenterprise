Configure GEE Server 5.1.0 for SSL/HTTPS

Data transmission between Google Earth EC and GEE Server occurs on
unencrypted HTTP by default. However, you may have strict requirements
that secure HTTP (HTTPS) be used for all data communications. This
article provides the steps to configure a GEE Server release 5.1.0 for
use with HTTPS.

We also include the steps required to generate a self-signed SSL
certificate for your server but we recommend you obtain a third-party
certificate from a CA (Certificate Authority). Third-party
certificates generally are trusted and do not lead to any issues with
warning messages or exceptions. However, you may want to set up your
own self-signed certificates to get up and running quickly.

Requirements

Generate self-signed SSL certificate and key

Apply third-party/CA-verified certificates and keys

Setting up SSL/HTTPS

Set your virtual host as a SSL server

-[ Requirements ]-

Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.1.0

A third-party or self-signed SSL certificate. Instructions for
generating the latter are provided in the following setup procedure.

-[ Generate self-signed SSL certificate and key ]-

A self-signed server certificate is generated for demonstration
purposes in the following steps. If you are using a CA-verified server
certificates and keys, see the following section,

Apply third-party/CA-verified certificates and keys

.

-[ To generate a self-signed SSL certificate and key: ]-

Change directory to the default certificate folder:  cd
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf  The default SSL certificate and key files
generated in the following steps and used in this example virtual host
are /opt/google/gehttpd/conf/server.crt and
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf/server.key respectively.  Your certificate
location and names may be different but make sure that they match the
entries in the httpd-ssl.conf file, as shown in Set your virtual host
as a SSL server.

Generate the server key:  openssl genrsa –out server.key 1024  It is
recommended that you do not use the –des3 option, which adds password
protection when a key is created. While this adds an extra layer of
security, it also requires manual input of the password should your
system accidentally power down and restart, for example. Instead,
generate the server key without a password or strip out the password
with openssl rsa -in server.key -out myservername_nopasswd.key and use
that instead.

Generate the server certificate based on the server key:  openssl req
–new –x509 –days 365 –key server.key –out server.crt  Include as much
information into the certificate as desired or accept the defaults,
that is, Country, State, City, Company Name, Department, Server Name,
and Administrator email address.

Test the server certificate and verify all information is correct:
openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt

-[ Apply third-party/CA-verified certificates and keys ]-

If you are using third-party/CA-verified certificates and keys, we
recommend renaming them to use the default names for the virtual host
configuration:

Change your third-party server certificate file name to
SSLCertificateFile /opt/google/gehttpd/conf/server.crt

Change your third-party/CA verified key file name to
SSLCertificateKeyFile /opt/google/gehttpd/conf/server.key

Optionally, if you choose not to use the default certificate and key
names, you will need to modify the entries in
"/opt/google/gehttpd/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf" with the custom names
accordingly, listed under "# Server Certificate" and "# Server Private
Key" respectively.

-[ Setting up SSL/HTTPS ]-

In this example procedure, you perform the following steps:

Add a virtual host ssl

Set up the Apache server configuration to serve virtual hosts over
HTTPS.

Restart GEE Server

Note: The virtual host name “secure” is reserved for GEE Server use.

-[ To add a virtual host for HTTPS serving: ]-

Register your new virtual host using the geserveradmin command. See
Manage virtual hosts.  geserveradmin –-addvh --ssl  The --ssl option
registers the newly created virtual host by creating a configuration
file with the naming convention: _host.location_ssl located in the
path <Apache path>/conf.d/virtual_servers/.  For example, to create a
location-based virtual host with a configuration file that specifies
SSL:  # /opt/google/bin$ ./geserveradmin --addvh test_ssl --ssl
Registering Virtual Host: test_ssl ... Virtual Host registration
successful. Location-based Virtual Host created:
/conf.d/virtual_servers/test_ssl_host.location_ssl

The newly created virtual host configuration file in this example,
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/virtual_servers/test_ssl_host.location_ssl,
includes the <Location> directives for SSL, in this case, test_ssl.
<Location “/test_ssl_host/*”>    SetHandler fdb-handler
SSLRequireSSL    SSLVerifyClient none </Location>  Use of the
SSLRequireSSL directive prevents all HTTP requests that do not use
SSL, thereby protecting your data from all but HTTPS requests. See
Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2 Documentation for more information.
Use of the SSLVerifyClient directive specifies the level of
certificate verification required for the client. See Apache HTTP
Server Version 2.2 Documentation for SSLVerifyClient for more
information.

-[ Set your virtual host as a SSL server ]-

Tip: All commands must be executed as the root user unless otherwise
  specified.

-[ To set your virtual host as a SSL server: ]-

Edit the Apache HTTP server configuration file,
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf/gehttpd.conf file, as follows:  Uncomment and
change ServerName www.example.com to ServerName MyServerName, where
MyServerName is the real address users would enter in the network.
Check that Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf appears and uncomment it.
Note that this Include for the httpd-ssl.conf configuration is
commented out by default as it should only be loaded if you serve a
virtual host over HTTPS.  Save and close the
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf/gehttpd.conf file.

Edit the Apache server configuration file,
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf file, which provides SSL
support. It contains the configuration directives to instruct the
server how to serve pages over an HTTPS connection. For detailed
information about these directives see Apache 2.2 documentation.
Ensure the ServerName www.example.com is uncommented and matches the
name defined in the /opt/google/gehttpd/conf/gehttpd.conf file, that
is, the alias or real address users would enter in the network.  Check
that the SSL virtual hosts configuration file location is already
included in the <VirtualHost _default_:443> list of directives:
<VirtualHost_default_:443>  Include
conf.d/virtual_servers/*.location_ssl  Save and close the
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf file.

Restart the Google Earth Enterprise Server software:
/etc/init.d/geserver restart

Publish a database to the SSL/HTTPS virtual host.

Test the connections with Google Earth Enterprise Client for HTTP and
HTTPS-based virtual servers.
