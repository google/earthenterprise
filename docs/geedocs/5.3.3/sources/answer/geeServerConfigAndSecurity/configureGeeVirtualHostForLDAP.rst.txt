Configure a GEE virtual host for LDAP authentication

You can use LDAP authentication, which is based on Microsoft Active
Directory, to authenticate users to access your GEE virtual hosts. GEE
server software is based on Apache "httpd".

It is easy to administer and manage user accounts. You can use a
simple ".htpasswd" to secure a GEE virtual host, then you can assign
the permissions levels via groups or user level. If you have an
existing Active Directory user catalog, you can use that instead of
implementing a redundant authentication system. For information about
enabling your Active Directory for LDAP, see the

OpenLDAP

 documentation.

Tip: This article explains how to configure a virtual host for LDAP
  authentication using GEE Server 5.x.

-[ To configure a GEE virtual host for LDAP authentication: ]-

Make sure that the LDAP modules are loaded on your Apache server. For
most GEE installations, these are loaded automatically.

Create a geserver Active Directory account that can access the user
directory, and make sure to document the attributes.

Load the modules in your
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/virtual_servers/private_host.location file
or your custom virtual host file.  After the modules are loaded, you
can control access by querying the directory for particular
attributes.

Point Apache to the LDAP server AuthLDAPUrl key directive.  An example
of an AuthLDAPUrl directive is:  AuthLDAPUrl
ldap://ldap.company.com/ou=People,dc=company,dc=com?uid  The key
directive format declares the LDAP server, the distinguished name
(DN), and the attribute to use in the search (typically the Uid
attribute in the People organizational unit). You can also customize
these filters for additional security constraints.

Restart the GEE server to load the modules into the system:  #
/etc/init.d/geserver restart

Create a user account in Active Directory geserver. This can be any
user account that has limited access. The user account only needs
access to the global catalog. Make sure that your user has the full
organizational unit name.

-[ To bind to Active Directory GUI: ]-

If you do not know your LDAP domain name, ask your system
administrator. You can also find your domain name by searching for it
in the format Dn: CN=geserver,CN=Users,DC=location,DC=company,DC=com.
In this example, the domain name is location.company.com.

Use your domain name to configure the Apache module. Alternatively,
you can use the command prompt:  dsadd user UserDN [-samid SAMName]
-pwd {Password|*}

Add the directives to your virtual server file at
/opt/google/gehttp/conf.d/virtual_servers.

For testing purposes, add the lines below to the private_host.location
file:  <Location /private/*>    AuthType Basic    AuthName "LDAP
LOGIN"    AuthBasicProvider ldap    AuthLDAPURL "ldap://server.name.l
ocal:389/cn=Users,dc=domain,dc=google,dc=com?uid"\    AuthLDAPBindDN
CN=geserver,OU=Users,OU=Yourorg,DC=DcNAME,DC=local
AuthLDAPBindPassword localuserpassword    AuthzLDAPAuthoritative Off
Require valid-user </Location>

Restart your server and try to access the virtual server via the
client. A login screen appears. If you cannot access Apache, open the
file error log at /opt/google/gehttpd/logs/error_log and access_log.
If AuthzLDAPAuthoritative is on, the client might continually prompt
for the username and password even though you entered a valid username
and password and the client is functioning. To correct this, turn
AuthzLDAPAuthoritative off.

-[ Directives ]-

require valid-user. Allows all users who log in with correct
passwords.

AuthzLDAPAuthoritative. Tells Apache whether a failed authentication
request can be passed to other Apache modules.

AuthLDAPBindDN. The distinguished name (DN) of the user account that
Apache uses to connect to the directory system and authenticate the
user.

AuthLDAPBindPassword. The password for the user account configured
with the AuthLDAPBindDN directive.

AuthLDAPURL. The URL that tells where the directory server is, where
to look for users at, which user attribute is used to identify a user,
and other miscellaneous things that are specific to the LDAP query
syntax.

AuthBasicProvider. Tells Apache which authentication module to use for
Basic Authentication.

For more information, see the Apache

mod_ldap

 and

mod_auth_basic

 documentation.

Tip: To troubleshoot any connection issues, begin by checking the
  logs on the LDAP server to make sure GEE server is correctly making
  authentication requests.
