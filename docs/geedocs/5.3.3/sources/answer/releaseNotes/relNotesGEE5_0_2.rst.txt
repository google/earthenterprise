   using the maxjobs option in /opt/google/etc/systemrc.  Stop Fusion
   daemons: sudo /etc/init.d /gefusion stop  Set maxjobs in
   /opt/google/etc/ systemrc.  Start Fusion daemons: sudo

   osgeo import gdal_array, a traceback error occurs: ImportError: No
   module named _gdal_array.  Fixed. The Python numpy library, which
   is required to load the gdal_array module, is now bundled with GEE
   Fusion.  11823150  When setting the maximum number of CPUs
   available for Fusion processes using the geselectassetroot
   --numcpus command, you cannot increase the value beyond 8.  Fixed.
   You can now set the maximum number of CPUs using the
   geselectassetroot --numcpus command to a maximum value of 64. You
   can verify the value you set using getop The default setting for
   the maximum value is 8. For more information, see Running Fusion on
   a machine with multiple CPUs.  15391728, 15386589, 15429155
