SourceFile

-[ Error message ]-

"Failed to open source_SourceFile"

-[ Description ]-

The vector Asset log displays this error when read-write-execute
permissions are not set properly. Permissions must be set for parent
folders up to the root level.

-[ Resolution ]-

At the command line, enter:

"sudo chmod -R a+r /gevol"

This command corrects the access permissions on all Fusion-related
files. If "/gevol" is not your asset root, replace it with the name of
your asset root.
