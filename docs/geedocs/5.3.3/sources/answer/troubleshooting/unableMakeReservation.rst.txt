Unable to make reservation

-[ Error message ]-

"Not enough disk space to make reservation for output files. Task
<task_name>: unable to make reservation <volume>/<path>:<size>"

-[ Description ]-

Fusion was unable to allocate space for the output files before
building the resource. This error is typically a result of
insufficient disk space for the Fusion output files, although it might
be the result of some other I/O problem on the volume.

-[ Resolution ]-

Run "df -h" to see if you have space left on the asset root partition.
If you are low on space, use "geserveradmin" to delete some of the old
databases that have been published to the server and then run
"garbagecollect" to clean up the old data. You can also use the
"geclean" command to remove the asset version, and "geserveradmin
--deletedb" to remove published databases. You should also verify
ownership and permissions on the asset root and check that mount
points are intact.
