Fusion diagnostics

The "geecheck" script provides information about Fusion server
versioning, configuration, and current system state.

To run "geecheck" on your Fusion server:

Go to /opt/google/share/support/geecheck on your Fusion system.

Run the script geecheck.pl.  You might be prompted to enter a username
and password. If you are not using authentication for the Fusion
server, you can ignore the prompts.

Examine the output for potential errors and problems. If you need
additional help, you can create a new issue on the GitHub repo that
includes the output of geecheck.pl.
