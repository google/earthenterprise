-[ Error message ]-

"Unable to decompress pyramid data Fusion Fatal: PrepLoop: Unable to
read tile (lrc)"

-[ Description ]-

This error occurs when you try to build an imagery project with a
corrupt imagery resouce.

-[ Resolution ]-

If the imagery project must be finished as soon as possible and the
failed imagery resource can be omitted:  Drop the failed imagery
resource from the project. A new version of the imagery project will
be built that does not include the corrupt imagery resource.

If the imagery project must be finished as soon as possible, the
failed imagery resource must be included, and the source is based on
prebuilt imagery .kip/.kmp folders from another machine:  Verify that
all .pyr files in both the .kip and .kmp folders are their true size
between both systems, then replace any .pyr files that have
differences between file sizes or checksums. To check for differences,
calculate md5 checksums for each pyramid file in the source folders
and the target folders. You can restart the failed imagery project
blend, or blends, afterward.

If the imagery project does not have an immediate deadline, the failed
imagery resource must be included, and the imagery resource was
imported from raw source files (such as JPEG2000 or GeoTIFF) that have
good integrity and are not corrupt:  Re-import the source imagery as a
new version of the imagery resource. Build a new version of the
imagery project to blend the new version of the imagery resource.
