Permission denied

-[ Error message ]-

"Permission denied"

-[ Description ]-

Fusion tried to read from or write to disk and permission was denied,
indicating that read/write permissions are not set correctly.

Background daemons run as the "gefusionuser:gegroup" user and group
build assets in Fusion. Even if a file has the correct permissions
set, the Fusion daemons cannot access it unless all of the parent
directories have both "read" and "execute" permissions set for
"gefusionuser:gegroup". You must be particularly careful to set
permissions that allow these Fusion daemons to access any source files
that you create or copy. Typically, you should grant "read" access for
all.

Publishing while logged in as "root" can cause permissions errors such
as this. If you were previously able to publish and are now getting
this error, correct the errors and publish under a user-level profile.

-[ Resolution ]-

Enter this command:

"chmod -R 755 /src"

Replace "src" with the top-level folder that contains your resources.
