Publish default database

Google Earth Enterprise (GEE) Server allows users to publish one 3D
database as the default database. This is the database that will be
served when Earth Client signs into the base URL without including a
database name.

-[ Publishing as Default ]-

To make a 3D database the default database, simply check the "Default
Database" checkbox when publishing the database.


This can also be done from the command line by including the "--
setecdefault" option with the "geserveradmin --publishdb" command.

e.g., "geserveradmin --publishdb SFDb_3d --targetpath SFDb_3d
--setecdefault"

Note that only one database can be the default, and the "last one
wins" if multiple databases are published with the "Default Database"
box checked.

-[ Viewing the Default Database ]-

To view the default database in Earth Client, simply sign into the
base URL of the GEE Server. (e.g.,

http://my-opengee-server.com

)
