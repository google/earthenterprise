(Deprecated) Provide Google Earth Plug-in for your users to install

Warning: The Google Earth Plug-in is deprecated and is no longer
  available for download. This page is only applicable if you have a
  copy of the Google Earth Plug-in from a previous relationship with
  Google.

If your users want to connect to GEE Server and view databases in a
browser, they must install the Google Earth Plug-in. They must also
use a browser that supports NPAPI, which excludes most modern
browsers. If they do not already have the plug-in, you can provide the
installer so that the plug-in downloads when they attempt to connect
to GEE Server.

The plug-in installer should be placed in the following directory on

GEE Server

:

"/opt/google/gethttpd/htdocs/earth/plugin"

The directory includes "install.html", a landing page from which the
installers are launched. When a user attempts to connect without the
plug-in installed, they are automatically directed here from
earth_local.html's default error page. There are two installers, which
should be renamed as follows:

/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/earth/plugin/GoogleEarth-Mac-Plugin-
Latest.dmg

/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/earth/plugin/GoogleEarth-Windows-Plugin-
Latest.msi

These installers do not require administrative rights on the user's
machine. They also do not auto-update. If users are unable to download
the installer from this location, they should contact their system
administrator.

Tip: The Google Earth Plug-in installer for Windows requires
  administrative rights when installing to Internet Explorer.
