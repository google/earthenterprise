Map projections

Google Maps use Mercator projection for browser-based maps. When
Fusion creates a map that uses

maps.google.com

 imagery as the source, it uses Google Maps projection for the
rasterized vectors so that they match the underlying Google Map tiles.
This EPSG code is

EPSG:900913

 or

EPSG:3785

.

However, GEE builds 3D data using the

WGS84

 datum (

EPSG:4326

). If you want to reuse 3D database resources, you can create a flat
map using the Fusion Flat (Plate Carr√©e) projection.

If you build a Mercator-based database, you must build resources
specifically for use with Mercator-based projection.
