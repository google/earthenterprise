      Once you publish a 2D database, you can view it from Google Earth
      Enterprise Server or in any browser. You can also interact with
      map layers you created in a 2D database using the
      ``geeCreateFusionMap`` class of :doc:`../developers/googleMapsAPIV3ForGEE`.

      .. rubric:: To view your map database from Google Earth Enterprise
         Server:

      #. Log in to the Admin console of Google Earth Enterprise Server.

         The Admin console opens to the **Databases** page.

      #. Check the box next to the map database that you want to view.
      #. Click **Preview**.

         A new browser tab opens displaying your map database.

      .. rubric:: To view your map database in any browser:

      #. Launch any web browser.
      #. Point your browser to:

         *http://myserver.mydomainname/publish_point*

         where *myserver.mydomainname* is the host name or IP address of
         your server to which you published the map database, and
         *publish_point* is the publish point that you specified when
         the published the map database. For example:
         *http://my_host_name/mysanfranciscomap*

         .. tip::

            If you are not sure which server you published to, contact
            your Google Earth Enterprise Server administrator for help.

      #. The map database displays in your browser.

      .. rubric:: Using the Google Maps API

      The Fusion Maps API is used to create and interact with map layers
      created in Google Earth Enterprise. The API is based on the Google
      Maps API but includes an additional ``geeCreateFusionMap`` class
      that makes it easier to interact with map layers generated by
      Google Earth Enterprise.
