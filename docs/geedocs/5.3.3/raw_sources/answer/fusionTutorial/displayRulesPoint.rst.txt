Configuring Display Rules for Point Data
========================================

.. container::

   .. container:: content

      Point data can provide useful information about points of interest
      (POIs) around the globe or even in your home town. Google Earth
      Enterprise Fusion allows you to configure the display rules for
      point data to distinguish different types of information. This
      lesson guides you through the process of graphically
      distinguishing the popular places in California using display
      rules.

      .. _Define_Vector_Product3:
      .. rubric:: Define, Configure, and Build a Vector Project
         :name: define-configure-and-build-a-vector-project

      This exercise walks you through the process of defining,
      configuring, and building a vector project using a resource you
      created in :doc:`../fusionTutorial/buildResource`.

      .. rubric:: To define and build a vector project and configure
         display rules for points:
         :name: to-define-and-build-a-vector-project-and-configure-display-rules-for-points

      #. Select **Asset Manager** from the **Tools** menu.

         The Asset Manager appears.

      #. Click |Vector Project Icon| on the toolbar. The Vector Project
         Editor appears.
      #. Click |New Icon|. The Open dialog appears.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Vector`` folder.
      #. Select **CA_POIs** (a resource that you built in :doc:`../fusionTutorial/buildResource`), and click
         **Open**. The CA_POIs resource appears in the Vector Project
         Editor.

         |CA_POIs Resource|

      #. Right-click **CA_POIs** and select **Configure Display Rules**
         from the context menu.
         The Display Rules dialog appears with the Feature tab in the
         foreground and the **default select all** rule highlighted.

      #. Specify the geometry characteristics of the POIs:

         a. For **Draw Features As**, select **Points**.
         b. For **Simplification Method**, select **Representative Subset Per
            Tile**.
         c. For **Choose**, accept the default, **50**\ % points.
         d. For **Min Points**, enter **50**.
         e. For **Max Points**, enter **200**.
         f. Check the box next to **Suppress Duplicate Points**.
         g. Under **Elevation/Height**, set Mode to **Clamp to Ground.**
         h. On the right side of the dialog, check the box next to **Draw Label**.
         i. For **Visibility**, accept the default range, **5** through **24**.
         j. Do not make any changes under **Label Properties**.

            This area allows you to specify the content and appearance of a
            text label for each POI. However, there are so many POIs in
            California that the view in Google Earth EC would be too crowded.

      #. Check the box next to **Draw Icon** and then:

         a. Click the icon pair. The Icons dialog appears.

            |Icons Dialog|

         b. Scroll down, if necessary, and select **blue_star**, and click
            **OK**.

            A yellow star appears next to **Highlight**, and a blue star
            appears next to **Normal**. The result of this setting is that
            Google Earth EC displays a blue star for each POI, and when you
            mouse over the star (highlight it), it turns yellow.

         c. For both **Highlight** and **Normal**, accept the default color, white.
         d. For **Highlight**, accept the default scale, **1**.
         e. For **Normal**, change the scale to **0.89**.

            The result of these settings is that when you mouse over a
            star, Google Earth EC displays the yellow (highlighted) star a
            little larger than the blue star.

      #. In the **Balloon** section, select **Text**, and then click the empty
         text field. The Label Format dialog appears.

         a. Select **COUNTY** from the **Insert Field** drop-down list.

            «\ **COUNTY**\ » appears in the text box under **Popup Text**.

            .. note::

               You can use some basic HTML tags to format the
               Label text, if desired.

         b. To the left of «\ **COUNTY**\ » enter **<b>**.
         c. To the right of «\ **COUNTY**\ » enter **</b><br/><br/>**.
         d. Press **Enter**. Adding this HTML code formats the name of the county
            as bold, followed by two line breaks to separate it from the text that
            follows (next step).

      #. Select **NAME** from the **Insert Field** drop-down list.
         «\ **NAME**\ » appears on the next line of the text box.

         a. To the right of «\ **NAME**\ » enter **<br/><br/>**.
         b. Press **Enter**.

      #. On the next line, enter **Latitude:**, and then select
         **LATITUDE** from the **Insert Field** drop-down menu.

         a. To the right of «\ **LATITUDE**\ » enter **<br/><br/>**.
         b. Press **Enter**.

      #. On the next line, enter **Longitude:** , and then select
         **LONGITUDE** from the **Insert Field** drop-down menu.

         |image5|

      #. Click the **OK** button.
      #. For **Style**, select **Default** from the drop-down list.
      #. Check the box next to **Directions** to include **“To here”** and
         **“From here”** links in the description balloon in Google Earth EC.
      #. Click the **Text Color** button, and select a medium blue.
      #. Click the **Background Color** button, and select a light yellow.
      #. Click the **OK** button. You return to the Vector Project Editor.
      #. Select **File > Save**. The Save dialog appears.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/Projects/Vector``\ folder.
      #. Enter **CA_POIs** as the name of your project, and click **Save**.

         The new project appears in the Asset Manager when you select
         **ASSET_ROOT/Projects/Vector** in the asset navigation tree.

      #. Right-click **CA_POIs**, and select **Build** from the context
         menu. Google Earth Enterprise Fusion builds the project.

      .. _Define_And_Build_Imagery_Project:
      .. rubric:: Define and Build an Imagery Project
         :name: define-and-build-an-imagery-project

      Although you can build and publish a database that includes a
      vector project only, you cannot connect directly to your server
      with Google Earth EC to view that data unless your database also
      includes an imagery project. If you publish a database that
      includes a vector project only, you must use the **Add Database**
      command on the **File** menu in Google Earth EC to add the database to
      the base imagery after logging in to ``kh.google.com`` or
      another server that serves a database that includes imagery.

      This exercise walks you through the process of defining and
      building an imagery project using a resource you created in
      :doc:`../fusionTutorial/buildResource`.
      Since the focus of this lesson is on polygon display rules, it is
      not desirable to spend a lot of time building a large imagery
      project. So this exercise walks you through creating a small and
      simple imagery project.

      .. note::

         If you have already completed this exercise in
         :doc:`../fusionTutorial/displayRulesPolygon`, skip this exercise and move
         on to :ref:`Define, Build, Push, and Publish a Database for the
         Point Data <Define_Point_Database>`.

      .. rubric:: To define and build an imagery project:
         :name: to-define-and-build-an-imagery-project

      #. Enter **BlueMarble** as the name of your project, and click
         **Save**.

         The new project appears in the Asset Manager when you select
         **ASSET_ROOT/Projects/Imagery** in the asset navigation tree.

      #. Right-click **BlueMarble**, and select **Build** from the
         context menu.

         Google Earth Enterprise Fusion builds the project.

      .. _Define_Point_Database:
      .. rubric:: Define, Build, Push, and Publish a Database for the
         Point Data
         :name: define-build-push-and-publish-a-database-for-the-point-data

      This exercise walks you through the process of defining, building,
      pushing, and publishing a database using the projects you created
      in the previous exercise.

      .. rubric:: To define, build, and push a database:
         :name: to-define-build-and-push-a-database

      #. Click |Database Icon| on the toolbar. The Database Editor
         appears with no projects selected.
      #. Click |New Icon| next to Vector Project. The Open dialog
         appears.
      #. Navigate to ``ASSET_ROOT/Projects/Vector``.
      #. Select the **CA_POIs** project and click **Open**. The CA_POIs
         project appears in the Database Editor next to Vector Project.
      #. Repeat steps **2** through **4** to add **BlueMarble** as the
         imagery project.

         You do not need to add a terrain project for this exercise.
         Both projects appear on the list.

      #. Select **File > Save**.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/Databases`` folder.
      #. Enter **CA_POIs** for the name of your database, and click
         **Save**. The name of the database appears on the right when
         you select the ``/ASSET_ROOT/Databases`` folder in the asset
         navigation tree.
      #. Right-click **CA_POIs**, and select **Build** from the context
         menu. Google Earth Enterprise Fusion builds the database.
      #. Right-click **CA_POIs**, and select **Push** from the context
         menu. The Push Database dialog appears.
      #. Select the server association on the **Server Associations**
         drop-down list. The most recent version of the selected
         database is the default selection on the **Version** drop-down
         list.
      #. Click the **Push** button. Google Earth Enterprise Fusion runs the process
         of pushing the database to the Google Earth Enterprise Server,
         and displays a success message when it is done.

      .. rubric:: To publish a database:
         :name: publish-a-database

      #. Access the Google Earth Enterprise Server Admin console in a
         browser window by going to *myserver.mydomainname*.com/admin,
         replacing *myserver* and *mydomainname* with your server and
         domain.
      #. Sign in with the default credentials:

         -  Username: geapacheuser
         -  Password: geeadmin

      #. Click **Databases** to display the list of databases pushed to
         the server.
      #. Check the box next to the database you want to publish. The
         **Publish** button on the Databases page appears.

         |GEE Server Database Publish|

      #. Click **Publish**. The Publish dialog appears.
      #. Specify a **Publish point**, where the database will be accessible
         from. For example, if you specify CA_POIs-v001, it will be
         accessible from *myserver.mydomainname*.com/CA_POIs-v001.

      .. _View_Database_GEEC_1:
      .. rubric:: View Your Database in Google Earth EC
         :name: view-your-database-in-google-earth-ec

      This exercise walks you through the process of viewing your
      database in Google Earth EC.

      .. rubric:: To view your database:
         :name: to-view-your-database

      #. Launch Google Earth EC. The Select Server dialog appears.
      #. Enter or select the host name or IP address of your server in
         the **Server** field, and specify the **Publish point** that you
         selected when you published your map database. For example, if
         you specify CA_POIs-v001, it will be accessible from
         *myserver.mydomainname*.com/CA_POIs-v001.
      #. Click the **Sign In** button.
      #. Zoom in to the west coast of the US.

         When you zoom in enough, Google Earth EC displays blue stars
         all over California. The closer you zoom in, the more spread
         out the stars are and the more stars you can see. When you
         mouse over a star, it turns yellow. When you click a star, a
         description balloon displays the information you specified in
         the format you defined in the Display Rules dialog.

         .. note::

            If you cannot see the vector data, make sure the
            check box next to **CA_POIs** in the Layers panel is
            checked.
