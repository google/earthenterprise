Creating a Map Database
=======================

.. container::

   .. container:: content

      In addition to using Google Earth Enterprise Fusion to prepare and
      publish data in Google Earth, you can use it to prepare and
      publish data in Google Maps. Map data can be published with
      Google Earth Enterprise Fusion using Plate Carrée (EPSG: 4326) and
      Mercator (EPSG: 3857) projections, and is referred to hereafter as
      a *map layer*, *map project*, and *map database*.

      This lesson defines, builds, and publishes a Mercator map database
      and it also demonstrates how you can add an imagery project of
      *flat or Plate Carrée-based* imagery resources. When you publish
      the Mercator map database, the flat imagery is then projected as
      *Mercator on the Fly*. This feature converts a Plate Carrée-based
      imagery resource into a Mercator-based imagery resource when you
      define your Mercator map database. When hosted on GEE Server, the
      server requests the *Mercator on the Fly* imagery resource in the
      database and serves it with a Mercator projection.

      The option to project *Mercator on the Fly* enables you to reuse
      existing flat imagery resources for all your database types,
      including Mercator map databases, thereby saving you the task of
      creating and storing Mercator imagery resources. For more
      information, see :doc:`../fusionResAndProj/addFlatImageryToMercatorMapDBInGEE5.1.0`.

      .. note::

         **Note:** As an alternative to your own imagery resources, you
         can use the Google Base Map in place of an imagery project. See
         :ref:`Using the Google Base Map <Using_Google_Base_Map>` for more details.

      The first step in preparing any data for publication is to import
      the source data as Google Earth Enterprise Fusion resources. You
      can use one of the vector resources you defined in :doc:`../fusionTutorial/buildResource` for Google Maps.

      After you define your vector resources, you must define and build
      at least one map layer for each map project. The first exercise in
      this lesson, :ref:`Define a Map Layer <Define_Map_Layer>`, describes how to do
      so.

      The remaining steps are similar to defining, building, pushing,
      and publishing other databases that you have also created for
      viewing in Google Earth EC.

      .. _Define_Map_Layer:
      .. rubric:: Define a Map Layer

      Defining a map layer consists of adding resources to the layer and
      defining the display rules and filters for the layer. This is
      similar to the process of defining display rules and filters for a
      vector project destined for Google Earth EC.

      .. rubric:: To define a map layer

      #. Select **Asset Manager** from the **Tools** menu. The Asset Manager
         appears.
      #. Select **Mercator Map Tools (2D)** from the drop-down menu.
      #. Click |image1|. The Map Layer Editor appears.

         |image2|

         The legend area displays the current value of each property you
         can set for the map layer. The top row lists the names of the
         locales you support. When you first open this dialog for a new
         map layer, only the default locale and its values appear, and
         the box next to **Hide unspecialized locales** is checked.
         Google Maps uses the default locale settings when you do not
         specify different settings for a user’s locale in this tab.

      #. Set the property values for the default locale as follows:

         a. Click the icon in the **Icon** field, select **places3_new**,
            and click **OK**. This is the icon that appears next to the
            name of the map layer in the Layers panel of Google Maps.
         b. Click in the **Name** field, enter **CAfreeways**, and press
            **Enter** to save the change. This is the text label that
            appears in the Layers panel of Google Maps.
         c. For **Initial State**, accept the default setting, **Off**. This
            setting determines whether the map layer is turned on or off
            in Google Maps.

      #. Click **Add Resource**.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Vector`` folder.
      #. Select **CAHighways**, and click **Open**. The CAHighways
         resource appears on the resource list.
      #. Select **default select all** under the resource name.

         The **Feature** and **Filter** tabs appear on the right. The
         first option on the **Feature** tab is **Draw Features As**.
         This option allows you to specify the display rules for the
         selected resource. The value you set for **Draw Features As**
         determines the options available for you to specify.

         In this lesson, you define display rules for label only.

      #. For **Draw Features As**, select **Lines**. The **Lines**
         options appear.
      #. Under **Line**, accept the default visibility range for the
         lines, **8** and **14**.
      #. For **Color**, set it to orange.
      #. For **Line Width**, accept the default, **2**.
      #. Check the box next to **Label**.
      #. Under **Label**, accept the default setting on the drop-down
         list, **Text**.
      #. Click |Label Format Open|. The **Label Format** dialog appears.

         The **Insert Field** drop-down list contains the names of all
         fields in your source data.

      #. | Select **NAME**, and click **OK**.

         In the source file for the selected resource, the **Name**
         column lists the names of the roads, so when you select the
         **Name** field here, the names of the roads
         are displayed in Google Maps.

      #. For the label, change the visibility range to **10** through
         **14**.

         The visibility range refers to the zoom level at which your
         labels are visible in Google Maps.

      #. The default text style is black on white in the Sans 12 font.
         Click the text style button (labeled **Sans/12**) to specify a
         different text style for the labels.

         The **Text Style** dialog appears.

      #. For **Size**, change the value to **10**, and accept the
         default setting for **Color**, black.

         .. note::

            **Note:** In version 3.0 and beyond, only one font and style
            is provided, Sans regular. However, you can create a
            configuration file in which you can specify additional
            fonts, if desired. Refer to the **Administration Guide** for
            details.

         A preview of the label appears in the Preview box.

      #. Drag the preview over any button on the left. The new style is
         stored on that button. The button name reflects the font
         and font size of the style, and it appears with the selected color
         and outline attributes.

         After you save a style to a button, you can simply click that
         button to automatically select its text style settings for
         another label in the future.

      #. Click **OK**. You return to the Map Layer Editor, and the
         Feature tab shows all of your selections.

         |image4|

      #. Select **Save** from the **File** menu.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/MapLayers`` folder.
      #. In the **Name** field, enter **SFMapLayer**, and click **Save**.
         The new map layer name appears in the Asset Manager’s asset
         list.

      .. _Define_Map_Project:
      .. rubric:: Define a Map Project

      The first step in defining a map project is to specify which map
      layers to include and give the project a name. Before you define a
      map project, however, add a subfolder to the asset navigation tree
      in the Asset Manager in which you can store your map projects.

      .. rubric:: To add a subfolder for map projects

      #. Select **Asset Manager** from the **Tools** menu. The Asset Manager
         appears.
      #. Right-click **Projects** in the asset navigation tree, and
         select **New Subfolder**. The New Subfolder dialog appears.
      #. Enter **Map** in the **Folder Name** field, and click **OK**. The
         new Map subfolder appears under Projects in the asset
         navigation tree.

      .. rubric:: To create a map project

      #. In the Asset Manager, click |image5|. The Map Project Editor
         appears.
      #. Click |image6|. The Open dialog appears.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/MapLayers``\ folder.
      #. Select **SFMapLayer**, the map layer you created in the
         previous exercise, and click **Open**. SFMapLayer appears in
         the Map Project Editor.

         The default legend name of the map layer, **CAFreeways**,
         appears in the Legend Name column, followed by **<DEFAULT>**,
         which indicates that this is the name you specified for the
         legend when you created the layer. The name and path of the map
         layer appears in the Layer column.

      #. Double-click **CAFreeways**. The Layer Legend dialog displays
         the current values for the map layer.

         |image7|

      #. Double-click the name field, change the name to **California
         Freeways**, press **Enter** to save the change, and click
         **OK**.

         The new legend name appears in the Map Project Editor. Notice
         that **<DEFAULT>** no longer appears after the legend name. (If
         you want to return to the default name, right-click
         **California Freeways** in the **Legend Name** field, and select
         **Use Layer Defaults** from the context menu.)

      #. Select **File > Save**.
      #. Navigate to the ``ASSET_ROOT/Projects/Map``\ folder.
      #. In the **Name** field, enter **SFMapProject**, and click **Save**.
         The new map project name appears in the Asset Manager’s asset
         list.

      .. _Define_Flat_Imagery_Project:
      .. rubric:: Define a Flat Imagery Project

      The maps layer includes Google Maps layers and uses the Google
      Maps API from google.com. Map databases use either Plate Carrée
      (EPSG: 4326) or Mercator (EPSG: 3857) projections and normally
      require corresponding imagery resource types. In this lesson you
      add a flat imagery project from a previous tutorial lesson to a
      Mercator map database, which can then be
      projected as *Mercator on the Fly*. For more information,
      see :doc:`../fusionResAndProj/addFlatImageryToMercatorMapDBInGEE5.1.0`

      .. tip::

         If you did not complete the tutorial lesson to create an
         imagery project, see :ref:`Define an Imagery Project <Define_Imagery_Project>`

      loads Google base map tiles through the Google Maps Javascript API
      V3, and renders your map layers on top of them.

      .. note::

         **Note:** As per Google's terms of service, you may need to
         purchase a Maps for Business license if you are deploying your
         application in an internal environment.
