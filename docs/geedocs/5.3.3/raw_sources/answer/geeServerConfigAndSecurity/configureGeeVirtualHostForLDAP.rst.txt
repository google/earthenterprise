====================================================
Configure a GEE virtual host for LDAP authentication
====================================================

.. container::

   .. container:: content

      You can use LDAP authentication, which is based on Microsoft
      Active Directory, to authenticate users to access your GEE virtual
      hosts. GEE server software is based on Apache ``httpd``.

      It is easy to administer and manage user accounts. You can use a
      simple ``.htpasswd`` to secure a GEE virtual host, then you can
      assign the permissions levels via groups or user level. If you
      have an existing Active Directory user catalog, you can use that
      instead of implementing a redundant authentication system. For
      information about enabling your Active Directory for LDAP, see the
      `OpenLDAP <http://www.openldap.org>`_ documentation.

      .. tip::

         This article explains how to configure a virtual host for LDAP
         authentication using GEE Server 5.x.

      .. rubric:: To configure a GEE virtual host for LDAP
         authentication:
         :name: to-configure-a-gee-virtual-host-for-ldap-authentication

      #. Make sure that the LDAP modules are loaded on your Apache
         server. For most GEE installations, these are loaded
         automatically.
      #. Create a ``geserver`` Active Directory account that can access
         the user directory, and make sure to document the attributes.
      #. Load the modules in your
         ``/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/virtual_servers/private_host.location``
         file or your custom virtual host file.

         After the modules are loaded, you can control access by
         querying the directory for particular attributes.

      #. Point Apache to the LDAP server ``AuthLDAPUrl`` key directive.

         An example of an ``AuthLDAPUrl`` directive is:

         ``AuthLDAPUrl ldap://ldap.company.com/ou=People,dc=company,dc=com?uid``

         The key directive format declares the LDAP server, the
         distinguished name (DN), and the attribute to use in the search
         (typically the ``Uid`` attribute in the ``People``
         organizational unit). You can also customize these filters for
         additional security constraints.

      #. Restart the GEE server to load the modules into the system:

         ``# /etc/init.d/geserver restart``

      #. Create a user account in Active Directory ``geserver``.
         This can be any user account that has limited access. The user
         account only needs access to the global catalog. Make sure that
         your user has the full organizational unit name.

      .. rubric:: To bind to Active Directory GUI:

      #. If you do not know your LDAP domain name, ask your system
         administrator. You can also find your domain name by searching
         for it in the format ``Dn: CN=geserver,CN=Users,DC=location,DC=company,DC=com``. In
         this example, the domain name is ``location.company.com``.
      #. Use your domain name to configure the Apache module.
         Alternatively, you can use the command prompt:

         ``dsadd user UserDN [-samid SAMName] -pwd {Password|*}``

      #. Add the directives to your virtual server file at
         ``/opt/google/gehttp/conf.d/virtual_servers``.
      #. For testing purposes, add the lines below to the
         ``private_host.location`` file:

         .. code-block:: none

            ``<Location /private/*>``
               ``AuthType Basic``
               ``AuthName "LDAP LOGIN"``
               ``AuthBasicProvider ldap``
               ``AuthLDAPURL "ldap://server.name.local:389/cn=Users,dc=domain,dc=google,dc=com?uid"\``
               ``AuthLDAPBindDN CN=geserver,OU=Users,OU=Yourorg,DC=DcNAME,DC=local``
               ``AuthLDAPBindPassword localuserpassword``
               ``AuthzLDAPAuthoritative Off``
               ``Require valid-user``
            ``</Location>``

      #. Restart your server and try to access the virtual server via
         the client.
         A login screen appears. If you cannot access Apache, open the
         file error log at
         ``/opt/google/gehttpd/logs/error_log and access_log``.
         If ``AuthzLDAPAuthoritative`` is on, the client might
         continually prompt for the username and password even though
         you entered a valid username and password and the client is
         functioning. To correct this, turn ``AuthzLDAPAuthoritative``
         off.

      .. rubric:: Directives

      -  ``require valid-user``. Allows all users who log in with
         correct passwords.
      -  ``AuthzLDAPAuthoritative``. Tells Apache whether a failed
         authentication request can be passed to other Apache modules.
      -  ``AuthLDAPBindDN``. The distinguished name (DN) of the user
         account that Apache uses to connect to the directory system and
         authenticate the user.
      -  ``AuthLDAPBindPassword``. The password for the user account
         configured with the ``AuthLDAPBindDN`` directive.
      -  ``AuthLDAPURL``. The URL that tells where the directory server
         is, where to look for users at, which user attribute is used to
         identify a user, and other miscellaneous things that are
         specific to the LDAP query syntax.
      -  ``AuthBasicProvider``. Tells Apache which authentication module
         to use for Basic Authentication.

      For more information, see the Apache
      `mod_ldap <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ldap.html>`_
      and
      `mod_auth_basic <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_auth_basic.html>`_
      documentation.

      .. tip::

         To troubleshoot any connection issues, begin by checking the
         logs on the LDAP server to make sure GEE server is correctly
         making authentication requests.
