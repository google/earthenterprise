Add .kip imagery

      GEE can use pre-processed imagery in **Keyhole Imagery Product**
      (``.kip``) format. Each ``.kip`` folder has a corresponding
      **Keyhole Mask Product** (``.kmp``) folder that contains the mask
      for the imagery. The corresponding folders have the same name.

      To add ``.kip`` imagery to the asset tree:

      #. Store each ``.kip/.kmp`` folder pair in the same directory.
      #. Set read-and-execute permissions for the ``keyhole:users``
         account.
      #. Use the ``khnewimageryasset --havemask`` command to add the
         files. Specify the asset name, the provider information (USGS),
         and the location of the ``.kip`` folder. For example, if
         ``city_one.kip`` and ``city_one.kmp`` are in
         ``/gevol/src/preprocessed/noame/usa/``, the command is:

         ``genewimageryasset --havemask --provider (PROVIDER_KEY) -o path/to/asset/in/tree/gevol/src/preprocessed/noame/usa/city_one.kip``

      #. Repeat this step for each ``.kip/.kmp`` combination you want to
         add.

      You can access the assets from the Fusion Asset Manager whenever
      you want to use them in imagery projects. You are still required to
      build each asset in the system, but the build time will be
      insignificant because each ``.kip/.kmp`` combination is
      preprocessed.
