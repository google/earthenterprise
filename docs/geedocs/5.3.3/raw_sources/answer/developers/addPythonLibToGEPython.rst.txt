==================================
Add Python Libraries to GEE Python
==================================

.. container::

   .. container:: content

      GEE uses system Python with some extra libraries to support
      functionality such as publishing and custom search plug-ins.

      Additional modules specific to GEE are installed in:

      ``/opt/google/gepython/Python-2.7.x/lib/python2.7/site-packages``
      , where x is determined by the system Python version.

      -  ``psycopg2`` is a PostgreSQL database adapter
      -  ``google/protobuf`` is Google's serialization mechanism for
         structured data.
      -  ``mgrs`` provides conversion to and from MGRS
      -  ``GDAL`` (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) Python library

      .. rubric:: Add a Python library

      You can add a Python library to either the system Python path, or
      to the ``/opt/google/gepython/Python-2.7.x`` path for it to be
      enabled with GEE. One of the easiest ways to install a Python
      library is to use the Python package tool, ``pip``. You may also
      need to consider any other dependencies for your newly installed
      library.
