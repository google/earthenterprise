   .. container:: content

      You can tune the performance of Fusion by setting up task rules
      and by modifying the sizes of the asset caches.

      .. _Configure_Task_Rules:
      .. rubric:: Configure task rules

      You can use *task rules* to change how Fusion builds data. As soon
      as you implement a task rule, it customizes how specific processes
      in Fusion operate. In other words, you cannot apply task rules to
      individual assets or projects.

      -  :ref:`Set the number of CPUs assigned to Fusion
         processing <Set_Number_CPUs>`
      -  :ref:`Task rule types <Task_Rule_Types>`
      -  :ref:`Implement task rules <Implement_Task_Rules>`

      .. _Set_Number_CPUs:
      .. rubric:: Set the number of CPUs assigned to Fusion processing

      As some of the task rules described here rely on setting the
      number of CPUs assigned to Fusion processing, it is useful for you
      to know how many CPUs are available on your machine and how many
      are assigned for Fusion processing. The ``getop`` output lists the
      available CPUs on your machine as the ``maxjobs`` entry and
      corresponds to how many concurrent jobs Fusion may spawn at any
      one time.

      You can use the tool
      ``geselectassetroot --assetroot path --numcpus`` to assign more
      CPUs. For example:

      ``geselectassetroot --assetroot /gevol/assets --numcpus 7``

      For information about assigning CPUs to Fusion processing, see
      :doc:`../fusionAdministration/multipleCPUConfig`.

      Task rules impact Fusion processing in two different ways: by
      enabling/disabling multithreading, and by specifying output
      locations (KRP/KRMP), as shown in the following table.

      .. _Task_Rule_Types:
      .. rubric:: Task rule types
         :name: task-rule-types

      .. container::

         ============================= ====================== ===========================================================================================================================================================================================
         Task rule type                Task rule              Description
         ============================= ====================== ===========================================================================================================================================================================================
         Enable/Disable Multithreading **ImageryPacketLevel** Makes imagery project builds faster by assigning multiple CPUs to each task.
         Enable/Disable Multithreading **TerrainPacketLevel** Makes terrain project builds faster by assigning multiple CPUs to each task.
         Enable/Disable Multithreading **CombinedTerrain**    Makes 3D database builds faster by assigning multiple CPUs to terrain completion tasks.
         Enable/Disable Multithreading **MapLayerLevel**      Makes 2D database builds faster by assigning multiple CPUs to each task.
         Specify output locations      **KRP**                Lets you specify the location where image resources will be written by Fusion for better storage management.
         Specify output locations      **KRMP**               Lets you specify the location where mask files will be written by Fusion for better storage management. Note that the same storage volume must be specified for the KRMP as the KRP.
         ============================= ====================== ===========================================================================================================================================================================================

      You can add one or more of these task rules to your asset rootâ€™s
      ``.config`` directory.

      .. _Implement_Task_Rules:
      .. rubric:: Implement task rules

      To implement a task rule:

      #. Make sure you have superuser privileges, i.e., root or sudo
         access.
      #. Create the task rule using the XML sample code shown below for
         each rule.
      #. Depending on the rule you want to use, name the task rule:

         -  **ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule**
         -  **TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule**
         -  **CombinedTerrain.taskrule**
         -  **MapLayerLevel.taskrule**
         -  **KRP.taskrule**
         -  **KRMP.taskrule**

         .. note::

            Fusion uses these names when the tasks run, so
            do not change them.

      #. For the KRP and KRMP task rules, define the volumes you want
         Fusion to write files to. See `Defining
         volumes <#defining_volumes>`__.
      #. Set file permissions to read-only for all (``chmod 444``).
      #. Set file ownership to the ``gefusionuser`` user account and
         ``gegroup`` group (``chown gefusionuser:gegroup``).
      #. Place the task rule files in the asset root's ``.config``
         directory.
      #. Restart the system manager using the ``/etc/init.d/gefusion``
         **``stop``** and **``start``** commands.

      .. rubric:: ImageryPacketLevel task rule

      During a project build, Fusion will have multiple concurrent
      imagery project tasks. The watchpoint is balancing the total
      number of CPUs assigned for Fusion, and the number of CPUs
      assigned for each imagery project process. For example, with eight
      CPUs assigned for Fusion, with two CPUs per imagery project task,
      you can have four concurrent imagery project tasks.

      .. note::

         Assigning more than two CPUs for each imagery project
         task does not necessarily speed up processing, so you should
         keep the ``maxNumCPU`` value at 2.

      .. rubric:: Sample: ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule

      .. code-block:: xml

         <TaskRule>
           <taskname>ImageryPacketLevel</taskname>
           <inputConstraints/>
           <outputConstraints/>
           <cpuConstraint>
             <minNumCPU>2</minNumCPU>
             <maxNumCPU>2</maxNumCPU>
           </cpuConstraint>
         </TaskRule>

      .. rubric:: TerrainPacketLevel task rule

      During a project build, Fusion will have multiple concurrent
      terrain project tasks. The watchpoint is balancing the total
      number of CPUs assigned for Fusion and the number of CPUs
      assigned for each imagery project process. For example, with eight
      CPUs assigned for Fusion, with two CPUs per terrain project task,
      you can have four concurrent terrain project tasks.

      By default, Fusion assigns one CPU to work on each terrain project
      task. You can use this task rule to assign up to six CPUs instead.
      Set the minimum CPU value to a number from 1 to 6, and set the
      maximum to a number between 2 and 6.

      .. rubric:: Sample: TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule

      .. code-block:: xml

         <TaskRule>
           <taskname>TerrainPacketLevel</taskname>
           <inputConstraints/>
           <outputConstraints/>
           <cpuConstraint>
             <minNumCPU>1</minNumCPU>
             <maxNumCPU>6</maxNumCPU>
           </cpuConstraint>
         </TaskRule>

      .. rubric:: CombinedTerrain task rule

      Since ``gecombineterrain`` is a serial process and must be
      completed before the other database-level building activities can
      start, you can use the CombinedTerrain task rule to assign all
      available CPUs to the build. For example, with eight CPUs assigned for
      Fusion, assuming that one CPU is reserved for the system, you can
      assign seven CPUs to the CombinedTerrain serial process.

      .. rubric:: Sample: CombinedTerrain.taskrule

      .. code-block:: xml

         <TaskRule>
           <taskname>CombinedTerrain</taskname>
           <inputConstraints/>
           <outputConstraints/>
           <cpuConstraint>
             <minNumCPU>7</minNumCPU>
             <maxNumCPU>7</maxNumCPU>
           </cpuConstraint>
         </TaskRule>

      .. rubric:: MapLayerLevel task rule

      By default, Fusion assigns one CPU to work on map tile generation.
      As ``maptilegen`` can be run concurrently, you can use this task
      rule to assign multiple CPUs instead. Set the rule to min/max 4 on
      a 2 dual-core CPU system (3 may work well enough). On a 2
      quad-core CPU system, set the rule to min/max 3.

      .. rubric:: Sample: MapLayerLevel.taskrule
         :name: sample-maplayerlevel.taskrule

      .. code-block:: xml

         <TaskRule>
           <taskname>MapLayerLevel</taskname>
           <inputConstraints/>
           <outputConstraints/>
           <cpuConstraint>
             <minNumCPU>4</minNumCPU>
             <maxNumCPU>4</maxNumCPU>
           </cpuConstraint>
         </TaskRule>

      .. rubric:: KRP task rule
         :name: krp-task-rule

      When Fusion creates an asset, it writes large imagery files to the
      raster.kip directory in asset root by default. You can manage your
      disk space by using the KRP task rule to write these files to a
      different volume. See :ref:`Example of File
      Locations <Example_File_Locations>`.

      In the sample below, the volume you have created is ``products``. To
      learn how to create a new volume, see :ref:`Defining
      volumes <Defining_Volumes>`.

      .. rubric:: Sample: KRP.taskrule

      .. code-block:: xml

         <TaskRule>
           <taskname>KRP</taskname>
           <inputConstraints/>
           <outputConstraints>
             <outputConstraint>
               <num>0</num>
               <requiredVolume>products</requiredVolume>
               <pathPattern>${assetref:dirname:sansext}-${vernum}${defaultpath:ext}</pathPattern>
             </outputConstraint>
           </outputConstraints>
           <cpuConstraint>
             <minNumCPU>1</minNumCPU>
             <maxNumCPU>1</maxNumCPU>
           </cpuConstraint>
         </TaskRule>

      You can also enter a second ``requiredvolume`` tag in your task
      rule to specify the next available volume in case the first volume
      fills up. However, you must to restart the system manager to
      trigger Fusion to wri.. code-block:: xml.. code-block:: xmlte files to the next volume.

      .. rubric:: KRMP task rule
         :name: krmp-task-rule

      When Fusion creates an asset, it writes the mask files to the
      ``mask.kmp`` directory in asset root by default. You can manage
      your disk space by using the KRMP task rule to write these files
      to a different volume. See :ref:`Example of File
      Locations <Example_File_Locations>`. In the sample below, the
      volume you have created is ``products``. To learn how to create a
      new volume, see :ref:`Defining Volumes <Defining_Volumes>`.

      .. rubric:: Sample: KRMP.taskrule

      .. code-block:: xml

         <TaskRule>
           <taskname>KRMP</taskname>
           <inputConstraints/>
           <outputConstraints>
             <outputConstraint>
               <num>0</num>
               <requiredVolume>products</requiredVolume>

             <maxNumCPU>1</maxNumCPU>
           </cpuConstraint>
         </TaskRule>

      You can also enter a second ``requiredvolume`` tag in your task
      rule to specify the next available volume in case the first volume
      fills up. However, you must restart the system manager to
      trigger Fusion to write files to the next volume.

      .. _Defining_Volumes:
      .. rubric:: Defining Volumes

      The KRP and KRMP task rules include a ``requiredvolume`` tag that
      indicates where to write files. You need to make sure that this
      volume is defined and has enough space to hold the files. To
      define the volume, use the ``geconfigureassetroot -- editvolumes``
      command, then edit the XML as shown in the sample below. In this
      sample, the volume you are creating is called ``products``.

      .. rubric:: Sample: volumes.xml
         :name: sample-volumes.xml

      .. code-block:: xml

         <products>
           <netpath>/gevol/products</netpath>
           <host>linux</host>
           <localpath>/gevol/products</localpath>

           <isTmp>0</isTmp>
         </products>

      .. _Example_File_Locations:
      .. rubric:: Example of File Locations

      The table below shows an example of the default file locations and
      the locations after applying the KMP and KRMP task rules. In this
      example, the asset root is ``/gevol/assets``, the volume you have
      created is ``products``, and you have built an asset called
      ``TestImage`` in the imagery subdirectory.

      .. rubric:: Cache configuration
         :name: cache_configuration

      ``gesystemmanager`` caches information about the assets and asset
      versions it is working with. The default sizes for these caches
      should work fine for most builds; however, increasing the cache
      sizes may speed up very large builds at the cost of increased
      memory usage. The cache sizes are controlled by the file
      ``misc.xml`` which can be found at
      ``/gevol/assets/.config/misc.xml`` (assuming your asset root is
      ``/gevol/assets``; if not, modify the path accordingly). The asset
      cache size is controlled by ``AssetCacheSize`` and the asset
      version cache size is controlled by ``VersionCacheSize``. Note
      that the asset version cache is generally larger than the asset
      cache because it may contain multiple versions of the same asset.

      Within ``misc.xml``, the following options are deprecated and are
      treated as if they are permanently enabled:
      ``DisablePacketLevelVersionCachePurge`` and
      ``ConsolidateListenerNotifications``.

      Also included within ``misc.xml`` is an experimental option that
      allows the user to limit the caches by memory usage instead of
      number of objects. This option is controlled by
      ``LimitMemoryUtilization`` and its default value is 0 (false). The
      maximum memory usage for each cache can be set with
      ``MaxAssetCacheMemorySize`` and ``MaxVersionCacheMemorySize``.
      This size is measured in bytes and the default setting is 1GB.
      While this option is enabled, the caches will not be limited by
      the number of objects in the cache. It should be noted that as of
      now the reported memory usage is very low and that this option is
      not recommended for production environments.

      The Xerces library maintains a separate cache for dealing with XML
      files. Users can modify aspects of this cache through a
      configuration file at ``/etc/opt/google/XMLparams``. This file is
      not created automatically as part of the Open GEE Fusion install,
      so users that want to modify the parameters below must first
      create an ``XMLparams`` file. The ``XMLparams`` file has the
      following format:

      .. code-block:: sh

         # comments are preceded by '#'
         # options are case-insensitive, and all need not be present

         # the initial size of the XML heap in bytes
         # default is 16384
         INIT_HEAP_SIZE=<value>

         # the max size of the XML heap in bytes
         # default is 131072
         MAX_HEAP_SIZE=<value>

         # the size of XML heap allocation blocks in bytes
         # default is 4096
         BLOCK_SIZE=<value>

         # whether or not to purge the XML cache; valid values are 0 or 1
         # default is 1
         PURGE=<value>

         # the level at which to purge the XML cache; can be 1 (most often) to 5 (least often)
         # default is 3
         PURGE_LEVEL=<value>

      .. rubric:: PackGen analysis thread configuration

      Within ``misc.xml``, there is an experimental feature for setting
      the number of threads to use while analyzing and creating packgen
      tasks. The number of threads is controlled by ``PackGenAnalysisThreads``.
      This option is experimental and may contain bugs.

      .. rubric:: Status request timeout

      Status requests to the system manager from clients like ``getop``
      must wait to be fulfilled if the system manager is already engaged
      in another task. The system manager has a timeout that specifies
      the maximum amount of time it should spend waiting to fulfill a
      status request before it times out. This timeout can be configured
      manually by setting ``MutexTimedWaitSec`` in
      ``/gevol/assets/.config/misc.xml``

      ``<MutexTimedWaitSec>60</MutexTimedWaitSec>``

      .. _graph-operations:
      .. rubric:: Improving Performance

      Included in ``/gevol/assets/.config/misc.xml`` is a
      ``GraphOperations`` option, and it may be set to ``1`` (true) or
      ``0`` (false). This enables optimized versions of certain
      operations. These options are experimental and may contain bugs.
