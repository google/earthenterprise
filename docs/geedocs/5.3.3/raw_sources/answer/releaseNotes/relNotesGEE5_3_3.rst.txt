Release notes: Open GEE 5.3.3
=============================

      Open GEE 5.3.3 is currently in development

      .. rubric:: New Features

      **Ability to set default database from admin page**. For 3D databases, there
      is an additional option in the publish dialog that allows the user to
      specify a database as the "default". The "default" database will be served
      to the client if the server URL is specified without a database name.

      **getop can retrieve and display information while gesystemmanager is busy**.
      Previously, ``getop`` could not display information while system manager
      was in the middle of major calculations. Now, this restriction has been
      removed for most calculations, such as when system manager is determining
      which resources overlap. 

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.3.3 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.3.3 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.


      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.3.2. Installing Open GEE 5.3.3 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.3.
