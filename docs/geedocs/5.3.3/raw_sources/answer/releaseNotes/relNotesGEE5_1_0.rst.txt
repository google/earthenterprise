      This document includes the following information about the Google
      Earth Enterprise 5.1.0 release:

      .. rubric:: New Features

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.1.0 release introduces greater map
      building flexibility with an additional Plate Carrée map
      projection and for the first time adds the ability to use flat
      imagery resources in all three database types. Whether storage
      space is a key consideration or performance speed when serving
      your map databases, GEE now offers different options when planning
      your imagery resources.

      **Support for Flat Projection** (Plate Carrée—EPSG:4326). The
      :doc:`Flat Projection <../fusionResAndProj/mapProjectTypesInGEE5.1.0>` map is useful because
      the imagery layers for Google Earth EC and Google Maps can share
      the same database.

      **Add flat imagery to a Mercator map database**; when the Mercator
      map is served on GEE Server, the flat imagery is projected as
      :doc:`Mercator on the Fly <../fusionResAndProj/addFlatImageryToMercatorMapDBInGEE5.1.0>`. Now that your
      Mercator map databases can share the same imagery projects as a
      Flat Projection map databases, you can save on storage space and
      database building time by eliminating the need for Mercator-based
      imagery.

      **Configure SSL/HTTPS with command line option**. You can now
      create and register a location-based virtual host using the
      command line tool ``geserveradmin --addvh --ssl``. See :doc:`../geeServerConfigAndSecurity/configureGeeServer5.1.0_SSL_HTTPS`.

      **Set TRANSPARENT and BGCOLOR parameters when making WMS
      requests**. You can now determine if your map should be
      transparent, allowing other map layers beneath to be visible, and
      you can also set the background color of the map. See :doc:`../geeServerAdmin/makeWMSRequests`.

      **Display All option for center labels for polygon settings in the
      Map Layer dialog**. By default, GEE will display center labels of
      polygons so that they do not overlap, hiding some labels where
      necessary. Alternatively, check the **Display All** option for
      center labels for polygon settings in the **Map Layer** dialog to
      show all labels of polygons, irrespective of whether they overlap.
      See :doc:`../fusionTutorial/createMapDB`.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

           - Workaround
         * - 17725523
           - When attempting to install GEE 5.1.0 on RHEL 6 using the GUI installer, the process is likely to fail.
           - To install GEE 5.1.0 on RHEL 6, use the command line installer for Fusion and Server instead.
         * - 17532512
           - When canceling the build process of a map database, the processes that build the map
             layer project will not be canceled.
           - When canceling the build process of a map database, you need also manually cancel the
             build process for the map layer project:

              #. In the Asset Manager dialog, right-click the map database name that you are trying to
                 cancel the build and choose **Asset Versions** from the context menu. The Properties dialog appears.
              #. Select the version that you want to cancel, right-click and select **Version Properties** from the
                 context menu to open the Version Properties dialog.
              #. Click the **+** next to **MapDatabase** to open the tree of assets in the database. Right-click
                 the **MapLayer** assets under **Project** and click **Cancel** in the context menu. The MapLayerLevels
                 processing is canceled. Close the Version Properties and Properties dialogs to return to the Asset Manager.

         * - 17363564
           - 3D databases with terrain projects, including overlay insets, that do not include worldwide coverage,
             may cause Google Earth 7.1.1 to crash.
           - Include worldwide terrain in all terrain projects, even when building overlays, as worldwide coveragei
             enables the regions of overlay inset to fill with values from the base terrain.i
             See :doc:`../fusionTutorial/buildProject` and :doc:`../fusionResAndProj/createTerrainOverlays`.

      .. rubric:: Resolved Issues

      The following resolved issues are incremental fixes and relative to the
      last official build, :doc:`GEE 5.0.2 <../releaseNotes/relNotesGEE5_0_2>`.

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 25 25 50
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Number
           - Description
           - Resolution
         * - 14254303
           - When installing Fusion, the GUI installer skips the screen that enables group and user name settings to be created.
           - Fixed. you can accept the default **user** name: *gefusionuser*, and **group** name: *gegroup* or specify
             your own custom names.
         * - 15290004, 15313028
           - When attempting to cancel a cut using the **Cutter** tool, the Cancel button does
             not properly kill any running task on GEE Server.
           - Fixed. The **Cutter** cancel process now kills any running task on GEE Server.
         * - 16618751
           - When attempting to specify the ``--lut`` option for the ``gevirtualraster`` tool, no file is specified.
           - The ``--lut`` option has been removed from the ``gevirtualraster`` command and supporting
             documentation as the LUT file type is not being used.
         * - 16135553
           - When the ``gemaskgen`` tool terminates in error, there is insufficient error logging.
           - A check for size of source/output raster and logging support for gemaskgen has been improved,
             providing more information about processes and when they are terminated in error.
         * - 17300345
           - When adding a new imagery resource to an existing imagery project that was originally built with GEE 4.4.1,
             adding a new imagery resource and rebuilding the imagery project with GEE 5.x fails.
           - Fixed. Existing imagery projects with older imagery resources now rebuild successfully.
         * - 16683365
           - The option to serve 3D databases using WMS has been deprecated.
           - Fixed. WMS now serves 2D flat projection map databases in addition to Mercator projection map databases.
             See `Make Web Map Service (WMS) requests <../geeServerAdmin/makeWMSRequests>`__.
         * - 16701881
           - When attempting to set the maximum number of CPUs used for Fusion processing tasks, **geselectassetroot
             --numcpus** fails to update the value specified.
           - Fixed. The **geselectassetroot --numcpus** tool specifies the
             :doc:`maximum number of CPUs <../fusionAdministration/multipleCPUConfig>` for Fusion processing.
