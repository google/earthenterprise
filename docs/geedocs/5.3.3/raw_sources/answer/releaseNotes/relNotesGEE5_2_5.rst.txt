Release notes: Open GEE 5.2.5

      .. rubric:: New Features

      **When a GEE server is queried for server definitions, the
      response can be returned in valid JSON format.** The ``v``
      parameter can be added to the query string to specify which
      version of the API to use. The options are ``v=1`` and ``v=2``.
      Version ``1`` returns data in the current format. Version ``2``
      returns valid JSON data. An example URL that returns data in JSON
      format is: ``http://<GEE earth server>/<database_publish_point>/query?request=Json&v=2``.

      **Additional options when publishing from the command line.**
      Users can now enable POI search, enhanced search, and WMS when
      publishing from the command line.

      **Portable globe packet dumps**. ``geglxinfo`` is now capable of
      extracting packets from 3D portable globes. This is useful for
      exploring the contents of a 3D portable file.

      **Continue past empty levels.** Cutter has a new advanced option
      when cutting from a 2D map. The "Continue past empty levels"
      option forces Cutter to continue building the portable file in the
      polygon region down to the region level even if the GEE server
      thinks there is no imagery to display at intermediate zoom levels.

      **Installation scripts are disabled when Open GEE packages are
      installed.** The install and uninstall scripts will now check if
      Open GEE has been installed with a package manager before
      installation begins, and will not make any changes when the
      packages are installed.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.2.5 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.5 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.

      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.2.5. Installing Open GEE 5.2.5 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.5.

      .. rubric:: Resolved Issues

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 25 25 50
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Number
           - Description
           - Resolution
         * - 200
           - ``stage_install`` fails on the tutorial files when ``/home`` and ``/tmp`` are on different file systems
           - Files are linked in ``/tmp`` using symbolic links back to original locations.
         * - 968
           - ``/etc/init.d/gefusion stop`` Does Not Ensure Daemons Stop
           - The System V init script has been migrated to using platform-specific utilities for
             starting and stopping daemons (Damonize on Red Hat, ``start-stop-daemon`` on Debian platforms).
             Those handle daemon states correctly. The ``gestartdaemon`` and ``gestopdaemon`` utilities have been removed.
         * - 973
           - Portable server builds require file generated by geserver build
           - The portable server builds fail because they are looking for
             ``earth_enterprise/src/version.txt`` generated by the full earthenterprise build.
             As a consequence, portable server cannot be build on Windows without manually creating the missing file.
         * - 1012
           - Cutter produces incorrect very low resolution result from 2D Mercator map
           - If a 2D map contains imagery at resolution level 24 and Cutter tries to create a portable map
             with a region level of 24 the resulting portable map will now contain the high resolution imagery.
         * - 1020
           - State updates are slow for large builds
           - Updating the state of asset versions used in large builds (such as when canceling or cleaning a project)
             is now much more efficient.
         * - 1037
           - Projects use different level numbers on the command line than in the Fusion User Interface
           - A new parameter, ``--maxleveloverride``, has been added for the ``genew*project``,
             ``geaddto*project``, and ``gemodify*project`` families of command line utilities.
             This parameter should be used instead of ``--maxlevel``, which is now deprecated.
             The new parameter matches the Terrain and Imagery levels displayed in the Fusion UI
         * - 1038
           - ``genewmapdatabase`` does not allow flat imagery to be used with Mercator databases
           - ``genewmapdatabase`` now looks for flat imagery projects as well as Mercator imagery
             projects when adding imagery projects to Mercator databases. Mercator imagery projects
             are given priority over flat imagery projects in the case of a naming collision.
             Flat databases can still only use flat imagery projects.
         * - 1079
           - Earth Client can hang on a portable globe cut from a server with historical data that no
             longer has access to the server.
           - A new parameter, ``--disable_historical``, has been added to ``gerewritedbroot``.
             This parameter removes the problematic reference to the historical data URL, allowing it to
             be viewed in Earth Client.
         * - 1105
           - Symlinks are incorrectly world-writable files after installation from RPM or Deb
           - Symlinks are now detected during the building of RPMs and Debs and are copied into the package correctly.
         * - 1120
           - Installing Fusion without Server using install scripts fails due to missing vars file
           - The missing vars file is now created upon Fusion install as well.

      .. rubric:: Known Issues

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 25 25 50

           - ``geselectpublishroot`` displays no help when the ``--help`` flag is used
           - No current work around.
         * - 1070
           - Scons build succeeds even if fusionui folder is missing resulting in the Fusion UI not being installed.

         * - 1026
           - High resolution imagery sometimes does not appear when paired with low resolution imagery and terrain

           - Ensure that a default ``g++`` compiler is installed.
         * - 669
           - Missing repository in build instructions for RHEL 7
           - Enable ``rhel-7-server-optional-rpms`` and ``rhel-7-server-optional-source-rpms`` repositories.
         * - 651
           - Release executables and libraries depend on gtest
           - Follow current build instructions that requires ``gtest`` to be installed.
         * - 640
           - Save button disabled in 'Map Layer' creation dialog when an error encountered
           - Close the resource form and re-open it to make the save option available.
