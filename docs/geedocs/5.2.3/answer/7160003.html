<h2>Release notes: Open GEE 5.2.3</h2>
  <h5>
    <p id="overview_5.2.3">New Features</p>
  </h5>
    <p><strong>C++11 support</strong>. With release 5.2.3 Open GEE C++ code now supports and defaults to compiling using the <code>-std=gnu++11</code> compile flag.  This default can be overridden and the C++ code can be compiled using the <code>-std=gnu++98</code> flag instead.  However, Open GEE 5.2.3 will be the last release to support compiling C++ code using the <code>-std=gnu++98</code> flag.  The subsequent releases after Open GEE 5.2.3 will no longer support the <code>-std=gnu++98</code> flag. All C++ code will need to conform to the gnu++11 standard.</p>
    <p><strong>Remove TCP/IP connections to PostgreSQL</strong>. With release 5.2.3 Open GEE code will now, by default, connect to PostgreSQL exclusively using Unix domain sockets. This will make it easier to secure PostgreSQL for security sensitive installations. For those upgrading from a previous release the following files will need to be changed before disabling PostgreSQL tcp listener:
      <ul>
        <li>/opt/google/search/conf/ExampleSearch.conf</li>
        <li>/opt/google/search/conf/GEPlacesSearch.conf</li>
        <li>/opt/google/search/conf/PoiSearch.conf</li>
      </ul>
      You will need to change the host from '127.0.0.1' to '/tmp'
    </p>
    <p><strong>Volume deletion</strong>. <code>geconfigureassetroot</code> now supports the option <code>--removevolume</code> for volume deletion.</p>
    <p><strong>Performance tuning for gecombineterrain</strong>. <code>gecombineterrain</code> now supports the option <code>--numCompressThreads</code> which specifies the number of maximum worker threads used to compress packets in this operation.  If not specified <code>gecombineterrain</code> defaults this option to match the number of available CPUs.</p>
    <p><strong>Package name customization at build time</strong>. Scons build now accepts a custom label argument which is appended to the version in RPM file names.</p>
    <p><strong>Rewrite KML URLs</strong>. Users can rewrite the URLs for KML resources included in databases at publish time.</p>
    <p><strong>Maps API Javascript Files</strong>. Maps API Javascript files are now available and installed at <code>/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps/mapfiles</code>.</p>
  <h5>
    <p id="supported_5.2.3">Supported Platforms</p>
  </h5>
  <p>The Open GEE 5.2.3 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the following operating systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the most recent security patches</li>
      <li>CentOS 6.x and 7.x</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.3 is compatible with Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.</p>
    <p><p>To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.2.3. Installing Open GEE 5.2.3 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.3.</p></p>
