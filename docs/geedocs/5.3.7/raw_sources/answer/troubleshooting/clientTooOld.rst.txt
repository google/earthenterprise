      ``Invalid protocol version (client too old)``
      
      .. rubric:: Description

      During the initial transition from tools that do not check for
      matching versions to the versions that do check (e.g., from
      2.4.x to 3.x), you tried to use an old version of the Fusion GUI
      or command line to connect to a new version of the system manager.

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      Ensure that you are using the same version of Fusion and GEE
      Server.
