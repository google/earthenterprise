      **New feature here**.
      New feature description goes here.

      In 5.3.5, we moved documentation, examples, and tutorials into a
      separate RPM called opengee-extra. This mainly includes the
      documentation, ExampleSearch, and Fusion Tutorial files.  You
      can choose whether to install opengee-extra depending on if you
      need those items.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.3.7 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.3.7 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.


      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.3.7. Installing Open GEE 5.3.7 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.7.
