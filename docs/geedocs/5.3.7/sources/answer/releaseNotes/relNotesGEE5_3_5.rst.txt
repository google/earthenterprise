you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.3.5.
Installing Open GEE 5.3.5 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that
your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded correctly to the
new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.5.

-[ New Features ]-

In 5.3.5, we moved documentation, examples, and tutorials into a
separate RPM called opengee-extra. This mainly includes the
documentation, ExampleSearch, and Fusion Tutorial files.  You can
choose whether to install opengee-extra depending on if you need those
items.
