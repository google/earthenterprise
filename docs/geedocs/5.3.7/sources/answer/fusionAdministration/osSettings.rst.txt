Operating System Settings That May Affect Fusion

The Linux operating system implements several limits that may prevent
Fusion processes from running correctly, particularly when building
large projects or databases.

You may need to reboot your system after making the configuration
changes below to ensure that the new configuration takes effect.

-[ Number of processes ]-

Linux limits the number of processes that each user can run. Since
Fusion runs many processes to build assets in parallel, you may need
to increase the limit by adding the following lines to
"/etc/security/limits.conf":

   gefusionuser  soft    nproc   <num_procs>
   gefusionuser  hard    nproc   <num_procs>

Fusion starts up to one process per core, plus two more (for the
system manager and resource provider). "<num_procs>" should be
considerably larger than that number to allow for operating system
processes.

-[ Number of open files ]-

Linux also limits the number of files each process can open at once.
Since Fusion may open many files when building an imagery project, for
example, you may need to increase the limit by adding the following
lines to "/etc/security/limits.conf":

   gefusionuser  soft    nofile   <num_files>
   gefusionuser  hard    nofile   <num_files>

"<num_files>" should be at least the number of resources in your
largest project, plus some extra to allow for the additional files
Fusion uses, such as configuration files.

-[ Number of memory mappings ]-

Fusion uses memory mapping when reading some types of files. Since
Linux limits the number of memory mappings each process can define,
you may need to add the following lines to "/etc/sysctl.conf":

   vm.max_map_count = <num_maps>

"<num_maps>" should be more than twice the number of resources in your
largest project.
