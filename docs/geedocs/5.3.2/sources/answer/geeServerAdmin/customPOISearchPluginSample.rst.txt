Custom POI Search plug-in Python code sample

The "Custom POI Search" search plug-in sample code uses the GEE Python
search module to query the

Google Places database (www.google.com)

 via the

Google Places API

. It demonstrates how to construct and query an external database
based on a URL search string, extract geometries from the result,
associate various styles with them, and return the response back to
the client.

You can find the two Python files for the "POI Search" plug-in in the
following location:

/opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/custom_POI_search_app.py

/opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-
bin/search/plugin/custom_POI_search_handler.py

In this Python module, an implementation has been provided to access
the

Google Places database

, format the results, and send the response in XML or JSON as per the
requirement. Valid inputs are:

location=lat,lng

radius = 10(in miles)

key = <server key required to access the Google Places database>

Further information about obtaining a server key is documented at:
