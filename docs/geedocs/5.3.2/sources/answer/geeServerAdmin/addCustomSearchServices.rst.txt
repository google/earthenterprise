Add custom search services

If you want to access a custom data source, you can create your own
search plug-in and access it as a search tab definition in Google
Earth Enterprise Server. A custom search plug-in will create requests
and responses using the common Python-based search framework, letting
you adapt your search to any data source. Your custom search plug-in
will receive search requests directly from Google Earth Enterprise
Client (EC), or any other clients in the form of URL parameters.

For example, with custom search plug-ins you can use Maps API and
Places API to leverage the power of their data sets. You can also use
a proprietary database, e.g., power conversion sites, then search for
the sites using internal IDs or city names.

A custom search plug-in may also provide a solution if you want to
search data that is not on your Google Earth Enterprise Server or you
want to combine Google Earth Enterprise databases in new ways. For
example, you may want to combine a Places search with your own vector
point data set, enabling your users to search by city name or facility
name. The custom search plug-in would forward your request to both the

POI Search

 plug-in and the

Places

 plug-in and return a merged set.

Note: Google Maps API and Places API access services over the
  internet, and require licenses to use.

Note: You will need some familiarity with Python to work with custom
  search plug-ins.

Configure search queries for Google Earth EC and Google Maps

Access Search Plug-ins

Implement your custom search plug-in

-[ Configure search queries for Google Earth EC and Google Maps ]-

Any web service, servlet, or web application you configure the search
tabs to query:

Must return valid KML to Google Earth EC.

Must return valid JSONP in the specified structure.

Warning: Because search tabs are returned as JSONP, they must
  originate from the same server as the HTML page containing the 2D
  map.

-[ Access Search Plug-ins ]-

The Google Earth Enterprise search plug-ins are stored in a default
directory that you can use to add or delete your custom plug-ins as
required. You can also modify the configuration file
"/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/mod_wsgi-ge.conf" to register new search
plug-ins with Google Earth Enterprise Server instead of creating
search tabs. The configuration file provides a convenient method for
managing search plug-ins with scripts, for example, to register newly
created plug-in endpoints so that they can be accessible when you view
your database in Google Earth EC.

You can access the plug-ins that are installed with Google Earth
Enterprise Server at:

"/opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin"

For example, access "/gesearch/ExampleSearch" in your browser as
follows:

"http://your.gee.server/gesearch/ExampleSearch"

The plug-in end points are for Google Earth Enterprise search plug-ins
are defined in "/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/mod_wsgi-ge.conf".

   # Handles Places search requests.
     WSGIScriptAlias /gesearch/PlacesSearch /opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/geplaces_search_app.py
     # Handles Coordinate search requests.
     WSGIScriptAlias /gesearch/CoordinateSearch /opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/coordinate_search_app.py
     # Handles Federated search requests.
     WSGIScriptAlias /gesearch/FederatedSearch /opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/federated_search_app.py
     # Handles Example search requests.
     WSGIScriptAlias /gesearch/ExampleSearch /opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/example_search_app.py
     # Handles POI search requests.
     WSGIScriptAlias /POISearch /opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/poi_search_app.py

-[ Implement a custom search plug-in ]-

You implement a custom search plug-in by creating your own Python
search application using WSGI, then registering the new search plug-in
so that it can be added as you publish databases.

-[ To implement a custom search plug-in: ]-

Create your search application, using the WSGI framework. See the
Example Search Python module for example code.

Locate your search plug-in, for example custom_search.py, in the
/opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-bin/search/plugin/ directory.

Register your plug-in by adding its definition in the Python module
configuration file: /opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/mod_wsgi-ge.conf. Your
registration in the configuration file should look something like the
following:  # Handles My Custom search requests. WSGIScriptAlias
/gesearch/CustomSearch /opt/google/gehttpd/wsgi-
bin/search/plugin/mycustom_search_app.py

Restart Google Earth Enterprise Server:  # sudo /etc/init.d/geserver
restart

Open the Google Earth Enterprise Server Admin console and click Search
tabs. The list of Search tabs definitions appears.

Click Create New to create a new search definition.

Add a name and label.

In the URL field, add the WSGIScriptAlias that you specified in the
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/mod_wsgi-ge.conf file. In this example, you
would enter gesearch/CustomSearch.

If you want to add query parameters that are hidden from Google Earth
EC, such as the way the results will be sorted or the number of
results displayed at a time, enter them in the Additional Query
Parameters field. The syntax is key1=value1&key2;=value2. For example,
sortby=name&numresults;=10 sorts by the name field and displays 10
results at a time. The search application must be able to understand
and respond to these key/value pairs, so you must be very familiar
with the search application to use this field.

Set the fields and other options as needed and click Save. Your new
custom search definition is added to the list on the Search tabs page.

When you publish a database, add your search definition from the
Search tabs drop-down list in the Publish dialog.
