Google Earth Enterprise Client lets you connect directly with your
organizationâ€™s private globes. You can sign in to as many databases as
you want.

-[ To view a globe in Google Earth EC: ]-

Launch Google Earth EC. The Select Server dialog appears.

Specify the Publish point by entering or selecting the URL or IP
address of your server and database in the Server field.  For example,
a Publish point of BayAreaHighways would be hosted at
http://myserver.mydomainname.com/BayAreaHighways, where myserver and
mydomainname are specific to your server.

Click the Sign In button.  If you have logged in to this server with
Google Earth EC previously, log out, clear your cache, and log back
in. For help with clearing your cache, see Clearing the Google Earth
EC cache.

Google Earth EC displays your database. The Layers panel shows the
terrain, imagery, and vector layers in the published database.
