Make Web Map Service (WMS) requests

Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x supports the

OpenGIS Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS)

, which provides a standard HTTP interface to request map images from
one or more published geospatial databases. Mapping images that are
provided through a WMS over the Internet can show information such as
weather formations and conditions, topographical maps, alternate high
resolution satellite imagery and more.

One of the benefits of using the WMS standard is that supported
clients can request images from multiple WMS servers and then combine
those mapping images into a single view. Because the WMS standard is
used to get all the images, they can easily be overlaid on one
another. Supported clients include

QGIS 2.0.1

, ArcGIS/ArcGIS Explorer Desktop, and

Google Earth Pro/EC

.

-[ Supported Database Types ]-

WMS is supported only with Fusion databases: 2D Plate Carrée and
Mercator.

-[ Supported Projections ]-

For imagery over WMS, GEE Server supports

Plate Carrée (EPSG code 4326)

 and

Mercator (EPSG code 3857)

, as well as legacy Mercator codes

EPSG:3785

 and

EPSG:900913

.

-[ Working with Other Projection Types ]-

To work with other projection types, you will need to perform
coordinate transformation in your client using

proj.4

 or another library . Alternatively, you can use an implementation of
the OGC WCTS to reproject your coordinates to one of the supported
ones. It is recommended that you use one of the well-known libraries
since you are only transforming two pairs of coordinates for a
bounding box.

Another example of working with other projections is to use a third-
party application such as MapServer to reproject your native WMS on-
the-fly, for example, to change your projection from Mercator to UTM
zone 35.

-[ Supported Image Formats ]-

The following image formats are supported:

PNG

JPEG

-[ Setting up Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x Support for WMS ]-

To enable WMS for a database that you want to publish:

In the GEE Server Admin console, click Databases.

Check the box next to the database you want to publish.

Next to Serve WMS, select On.

Click Publish.  Publishing a 2D Fusion or 2D portable database with
Serve WMS turned on publishes both to GEE Server and WMS; it is not
necessary to publish twice.

Databases that have WMS enabled are identified with a WMS label in the
description.


-[ Making WMS Requests to Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x ]-

The first step in creating maps via HTTP requests to Google Earth
Enterprise Server 5.x is to create a connection.

To connect to Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x, use the following
URL:

"http://<gee_server_name or ip
address>/<target_path_of_published_db>/wms"

   In this example, "http://localhost/merc/wms", “merc” is the target
   path of the published database. Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x
   supports the

   GetCapabilities

    and

   GetMap

    requests for WMS versions 1.1.1 and 1.3.0. Use

   GetCapabilities

    to first request metadata from which you can then specify the map
   images that you want to request using

   GetMap

   .

-[ GetCapabilities ]-

The

GetCapabilities

 operation requests information about the type of services and data
(“capabilities”) that are provided by Google Earth Enterprise Server
5.x.

The URL the GIS client should use to make the

GetCapabilities

 request is as follows:

"http://<hostname>/<target_path>/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilit
ies&VERSION=x.y.z"

The parameters for this operation are as follows:

GetCapabilities parameters        Parameter  Mandatory?  Description
SERVICE  Yes  Service name. Value is WMS  REQUEST  Yes  Operation
name. Value is GetCapabilities  VERSION  No  Service version is 1.1.1
or 1.3.0. If no version is submitted, the WMS request defaults to the
highest serving version; in this case 1.3.0.

An example

GetCapabilities

 request is:

"http://localhost/merc/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetCapabilities&VERSIO
N=1.1.1"

The response to a

GetCapabilities

 request includes the following information:

Image formats supported on a published target path basis for the maps.
Note that the target path database information is sent in the
connection URL.

A list of layers supported by the published target path database. Each
layer provides the following information:  Name of the layer  Spatial
projection supported  Bounding box limitations based on the projection
type

Formats supported for any exceptions, such as invalid requests
(requests not as per the international standards), service not
supported, etc.

An example

GetCapabilities

 request output is as follows:

         </Capability>
      </WMT_MS_Capabilities>

Once you have retrieved services and data information from Google
Earth Enterprise Server 5.x using

GetCapabilities

, you can then get the map image that you want using

GetMap

.

-[ GetMap ]-

The

GetMap

 operation requests the map from Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x,
based on the layer data that was discovered in the

GetCapabilities

 step.

The URL the GIS client should use to make the

GetMap

 request is as follows:

"http://<hostname>/<target_path>/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST= GetMap&BBOX
=<bounding_box_limits_of_the_requested_map>&SRS=<projection_type>&WID
TH=<width_of_requested_map>&HEIGHT=<height_of_requested_map>&LAYERS=<
layer_name>&STYLES=<style_info>&FORMAT=<format_of_requested_map>&DPI=
96&TRANSPARENT=TRUE"

The parameters for this operation are as follows:

GetMap parameters        Parameter  Mandatory?  Description  SERVICE
No  Service name. Default value is WMS.  REQUEST  Yes  Operation name.
Value is GetMap.  VERSION  No  Service version is 1.1.1 or 1.3.0. If
no version is submitted, the WMS request defaults to the highest
serving version, in this case 1.3.0.  LAYERS  Yes  Layer name for the
requested map/image.  BBOX  Yes  Bounding box for map extent. Value is
minx, miny, maxx, maxy in units of the SRS or CRS, depending on the
version. Use SRS for version 1.1.1; use CRS for version 1.3.0.  SRS or
CRS  Yes  Spatial Reference System (SRS) of map output. Value is in
form EPSG:nnn. Use SRS for version 1.1.1; use CRS as the parameter key
for version 1.3.0.  WIDTH  Yes  Width of map output in pixels.  HEIGHT
Yes  Height of map output in pixels.  FORMAT  Yes  Format for the map
output. PNG or JPEG are currently supported.  STYLE  No  Styles in
which layers are to be rendered. Value is a list of required style
names or empty if default styling is required.  DPI  No  Dots per
inch. Value is client-dependent. For example, the QGIS client defaults
to 96dpi.  TRANSPARENT  No  Determines if the map should be
transparent. Values are TRUE and FALSE; default is FALSE. This
parameter only applies when requesting PNG images.  BGCOLOR  No
Specifies the color to be used as the background (non-data) pixels of
the map. The parameter is a hexadecimal encoding of an RGB value where
two hexadecimal characters are used for each of red, green, and blue
color values. The values can range between 00 and FF (0 and 255, base
10) for each. The format is 0xRRGGBB; either upper or lower case
characters are allowed for RR, GG, and BB values. The “0x” prefix must
have a lower case “x”. The default value is 0xFFFFFF, corresponding to
the color white, which is used if this parameter is not included in
the request. When FORMAT is a picture format, WMS should set the
background pixels to the color specified by BGCOLOR. When FORMAT is a
graphic element format (which does not have an explicit background),
or a picture format, a WMS should avoid use of the BGCOLOR value for
foreground elements because they would not be visible against a
background picture of the same color.

An example

-[ Making WMS Requests in GIS Clients ]-

Any GIS client that supports WMS can query the Google Earth Server 5.x
using the URLs specified in this document. The following example shows
how QGIS connects to Google Earth Server 5.x, requests the server’s
data, and then requests the maps to display.

-[ Connecting to Google Earth Server 5.x WMS using QGIS ]-

To connect the Google Earth Server 5.x using the QGIS client:

Start the QGIS client application. At the top of the QGIS window,
click the Add WMS/WMTS Layer toolbar button or from the Layer menu
choose Add > Add WMS/WMTS Layer....  Add WMS layer feature

Click New to establish a new WMS layer connection. A new connection
window displays.  Create WMS connection dialog

Enter the following details:  Name for the connection  Connection URL
as http://<server>/<target_path_of_published_database>/wms, for
example, http://localhost/my_map/wms

Optionally, supply the username and password if the database has been
published to a secure virtual host set up with basic authentication.

Click the OK button to create a new connection.

In the same window, click Connect to make a GetCapabilities request
for a specific published target path database.  An example response
for a GetCapabilities request is shown in the following window.
GetCapabilities request response  The GetCapabilities WMS request
returns imagery and vector layers for 2D databases and only imagery
for 3D databases.

Determine which layer you want to display, then double-click the layer
name to send a GetMap request to Google Earth Enterprise Server 5.x.
The following example shows a map retrieved from a GetMap request.
GetMap request map retrieval

If you are adding layers from a 2D database to your QGIS project, be
sure to first set the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for the
project to EPSG:3857 (WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator) by clicking the icon
in the lower-right corner of the display window.  Set CRS dialog
