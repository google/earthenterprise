Manage snippet profiles

You can customize your database view and available features in Google
Earth Enterprise Client (EC) by setting up

snippet profiles

 in the the GEE Server admin console.

Snippets

 are different properties and options that may be specified for a
Fusion 3D database. When you connect to a database in Google Earth EC,
snippets control its appearance and behavior. GEE Server lets you set
your snippet preferences, then combine snippets into a

snippet profile

, which can then be applied to any database that you publish. The
snippet profile settings then modify the database's behavior and
appearance when you connect to it in Google Earth EC.

For example, many of these preferences (or

snippets

) apply to display characteristics, such as showing or hiding
different elements such as the Google logo or your own co-brand logo.
You can also apply other settings, such as caching data on disk,
enabling authentication, hiding user data in the

About

 dialog, and specifying a reverse geocoder server URL.

Tip: Google Earth EC recognizes only the settings made by the first
  database that you connect to in Google Earth EC. This applies when
  you are connecting to multiple databases.

Warning: If you are working with multiple GEE Server users on
  multiple workstations, it is important to remember that snippet
  profiles can be accessed by all users at the same time. Be sure to
  coordinate with any other users to avoid overwriting snippet profile
  settings.

-[ To create a snippet profile: ]-

Access the Google Earth Enterprise Server Admin console in a browser
window by going to myserver.mydomainname.com/admin, replacing myserver
and mydomainname with your server and domain.

Sign in with the default credentials or the username and password
assigned to you:  Default username: geapacheuser  Default password:
geeadmin

   Note: If you do not know your username and password, contact your
     Google Earth Enterprise Server System Administrator.

Click Snippet profiles to display your snippet profiles.

Click Create New. The Create new snippet profile dialog appears.  GEE
Server Create Snippet Profile dialog

Enter a name for the new snippet profile and click the Create button.
The snippet profile name appears in red in the Existing snippet
profile list and the Snippet editor opens.

-[ To edit snippet settings: ]-

Click the Add a new snippet set to the profile drop-down to display
the list of available snippets.  GEE Server snippet profile list

Select a snippet from the list. The selected snippet options are added
to the current snippet profile and appear in the profile list.  GEE
Server snippet examples  You can select some snippets multiple times
per profile, For example, you may want to add more than one customized
logo to be displayed in Google Earth EC. For those snippets that
cannot be added to a profile more than once, such as disable
authentication, the snippet name is grayed out and a checkmark appears
next to it in the snippet list.  GEE Server snippet profile list-
greyed

Edit the snippet profile to specify values for the snippets. See the
following Snippet Settings table for snippet settings.  When you add a
snippet, you must enter values in the empty fields; if you want the
snippet string to be empty, which is the default setting, you should
not add the snippet and edit its values.

When you have finished adding snippets and specifying values for your
snippet profile, click the Save changes button.  Now you can apply
your snippet profile to any 3D database you publish.
