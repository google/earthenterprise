Configure Fusion performance

You can tune the performance of Fusion by setting up task rules and by
modifying the sizes of the asset caches.

-[ Configure task rules ]-

You can use

task rules

 to change how Fusion builds data. As soon as you implement a task
rule, it customizes how specific processes in Fusion operate. In other
words, you cannot apply task rules to individual assets or projects.

-[ Set the number of CPUs assigned to Fusion processing ]-

As some of the task rules described here rely on setting the number of
CPUs assigned to Fusion processing, it is useful for you to know how
many CPUs are available on your machine and how many are assigned for
Fusion processing. The "getop" output lists the available CPUs on your
machine as the "maxjobs" entry and corresponds to how many concurrent
jobs Fusion may spawn at any one time.

You can use the tool "geselectassetroot --assetroot path --numcpus" to
assign more CPUs. For example:

"geselectassetroot --assetroot /gevol/assets --numcpus 7"

For information about assigning CPUs to Fusion processing, see

Running Fusion on a Machine with Multiple CPUs

.

Task rules impact Fusion processing in two different ways: by
enabling/disabling multithreading, and by specifying output locations
(KRP/KRMP), as shown in the following table.

-[ Task rule types ]-

      Task rule type  Task rule  Description  Enable/Disable
Multithreading  ImageryPacketLevel  Makes imagery project builds
faster by assigning multiple CPUs to each task.  Enable/Disable
Multithreading  TerrainPacketLevel  Makes terrain project builds
faster by assigning multiple CPUs to each task.  Enable/Disable
Multithreading  CombinedTerrain  Makes 3D database builds faster by
assigning multiple CPUs to terrain completion tasks.  Enable/Disable
Multithreading  MapLayerLevel  Makes 2D database builds faster by
assigning multiple CPUs to each task.  Specify output locations  KRP
Lets you specify the location where image resources will be written by
Fusion for better storage management.  Specify output locations  KRMP
Lets you specify the location where mask files will be written by
Fusion for better storage management. Note that the same storage
volume must be specified for the KRMP as the KRP.

You can add one or more of these task rules to your asset root’s
".config" directory.

-[ Implement task rules ]-

To implement a task rule:

Make sure you have superuser privileges, i.e., root or sudo access.

Create the task rule using the XML sample code shown below for each
rule.

Depending on the rule you want to use, name the task rule:
ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule  TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule
CombinedTerrain.taskrule  MapLayerLevel.taskrule  KRP.taskrule
KRMP.taskrule  Fusion uses these names when the tasks run, so do not
change them.

For the KRP and KRMP task rules, define the volumes you want Fusion to
write files to. See Defining volumes.

Set file permissions to read-only for all (chmod 444).

Set file ownership to the gefusionuser user account and gegroup group
(chown gefusionuser:gegroup).

Place the task rule files in the asset root's .config directory.

Restart the system manager using the /etc/init.d/gefusion ``stop`` and
``start`` commands.

-[ ImageryPacketLevel task rule ]-

During a project build, Fusion will have multiple concurrent imagery
project tasks. The watchpoint is balancing the total number of CPUs
assigned for Fusion, and the number of CPUs assigned for each imagery
project process. For example, with eight CPUs assigned for Fusion,
with two CPUs per imagery project task, you can have four concurrent
imagery project tasks.

Note: Assigning more than two CPUs for each imagery project task
  does not necessarily speed up processing, so you should keep the
  "maxNumCPU" value at 2.

-[ Sample: ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule ]-

   <TaskRule>
     <taskname>ImageryPacketLevel</taskname>
     <inputConstraints/>
     <outputConstraints/>
     <cpuConstraint>
       <minNumCPU>2</minNumCPU>
       <maxNumCPU>2</maxNumCPU>
     </cpuConstraint>
   </TaskRule>

-[ TerrainPacketLevel task rule ]-

During a project build, Fusion will have multiple concurrent terrain
project tasks. The watchpoint is balancing the total number of CPUs
assigned for Fusion and the number of CPUs assigned for each imagery
project process. For example, with eight CPUs assigned for Fusion,
with two CPUs per terrain project task, you can have four concurrent
terrain project tasks.

By default, Fusion assigns one CPU to work on each terrain project
task. You can use this task rule to assign up to six CPUs instead. Set
the minimum CPU value to a number from 1 to 6, and set the maximum to
a number between 2 and 6.

-[ Sample: TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule ]-

   <TaskRule>
     <taskname>TerrainPacketLevel</taskname>
     <inputConstraints/>
     <outputConstraints/>
     <cpuConstraint>
       <minNumCPU>1</minNumCPU>
       <maxNumCPU>6</maxNumCPU>
     </cpuConstraint>
   </TaskRule>

-[ CombinedTerrain task rule ]-

Since "gecombineterrain" is a serial process and must be completed
before the other database-level building activities can start, you can
use the CombinedTerrain task rule to assign all available CPUs to the
build. For example, with eight CPUs assigned for Fusion, assuming that
one CPU is reserved for the system, you can assign seven CPUs to the
CombinedTerrain serial process.

-[ Sample: CombinedTerrain.taskrule ]-

   <TaskRule>
     <taskname>CombinedTerrain</taskname>
     <inputConstraints/>
     <outputConstraints/>
     <cpuConstraint>
       <minNumCPU>7</minNumCPU>
       <maxNumCPU>7</maxNumCPU>
     </cpuConstraint>
   </TaskRule>

-[ MapLayerLevel task rule ]-

By default, Fusion assigns one CPU to work on map tile generation. As
"maptilegen" can be run concurrently, you can use this task rule to
assign multiple CPUs instead. Set the rule to min/max 4 on a 2 dual-
core CPU system (3 may work well enough). On a 2 quad-core CPU system,
set the rule to min/max 3.

-[ Sample: MapLayerLevel.taskrule ]-

   <TaskRule>
     <taskname>MapLayerLevel</taskname>
     <inputConstraints/>
     <outputConstraints/>
     <cpuConstraint>
       <minNumCPU>4</minNumCPU>
       <maxNumCPU>4</maxNumCPU>
     </cpuConstraint>
   </TaskRule>

-[ KRP task rule ]-

When Fusion creates an asset, it writes large imagery files to the
raster.kip directory in asset root by default. You can manage your
disk space by using the KRP task rule to write these files to a
different volume. See

Example of File Locations

.

In the sample below, the volume you have created is "products". To
learn how to create a new volume, see

Defining volumes

.

-[ Sample: KRP.taskrule ]-

   <TaskRule>
     <taskname>KRP</taskname>
     <inputConstraints/>
     <outputConstraints>
       <outputConstraint>
         <num>0</num>
         <requiredVolume>products</requiredVolume>
         <pathPattern>${assetref:dirname:sansext}-${vernum}${defaultpath:ext}</pathPattern>
       </outputConstraint>
     </outputConstraints>
     <cpuConstraint>
       <minNumCPU>1</minNumCPU>
       <maxNumCPU>1</maxNumCPU>
     </cpuConstraint>
   </TaskRule>

You can also enter a second "requiredvolume" tag in your task rule to
specify the next available volume in case the first volume fills up.
However, you must to restart the system manager to trigger Fusion to
wri.. code-block:: xml.. code-block:: xmlte files to the next volume.

-[ KRMP task rule ]-

When Fusion creates an asset, it writes the mask files to the
"mask.kmp" directory in asset root by default. You can manage your
disk space by using the KRMP task rule to write these files to a
different volume. See

Example of File Locations

. In the sample below, the volume you have created is "products". To
learn how to create a new volume, see

Defining Volumes

.

-[ Sample: KRMP.taskrule ]-

   <TaskRule>
     <taskname>KRMP</taskname>
     <inputConstraints/>
     <outputConstraints>
       <outputConstraint>
         <num>0</num>
         <requiredVolume>products</requiredVolume>
         <pathPattern>${assetref:dirname:sansext}-${vernum}${defaultpath:ext}</pathPattern>
       </outputConstraint>
     </outputConstraints>
     <cpuConstraint>
       <minNumCPU>1</minNumCPU>
       <maxNumCPU>1</maxNumCPU>
     </cpuConstraint>
   </TaskRule>

You can also enter a second "requiredvolume" tag in your task rule to
specify the next available volume in case the first volume fills up.
However, you must restart the system manager to trigger Fusion to
write files to the next volume.

-[ Defining Volumes ]-

The KRP and KRMP task rules include a "requiredvolume" tag that
indicates where to write files. You need to make sure that this volume
is defined and has enough space to hold the files. To define the
volume, use the "geconfigureassetroot -- editvolumes" command, then
edit the XML as shown in the sample below. In this sample, the volume
you are creating is called "products".

-[ Sample: volumes.xml ]-

   <products>
     <netpath>/gevol/products</netpath>
     <host>linux</host>
     <localpath>/gevol/products</localpath>
     <reserveSpace>100000</reserveSpace>
     <isTmp>0</isTmp>
   </products>

-[ Example of File Locations ]-

The table below shows an example of the default file locations and the
locations after applying the KMP and KRMP task rules. In this example,
the asset root is "/gevol/assets", the volume you have created is
"products", and you have built an asset called "TestImage" in the
imagery subdirectory.

        Task rule  File type  Default location  Location with task
rule  KMP  large imagery files
/gevol/assets/imagery/TestImage.kiasset/products.kia/ver001/raster.kip
/gevol/products/imagery/ TestImage-001.kip  KRMP  smaller mask files  
/gevol/assets/imagery/TestImage.kiasset/maskproducts.kia/ver001/mask.
kmp  /gevol/products/imagery/TestImage-001.kmp

-[ Cache configuration ]-

"gesystemmanager" caches information about the assets and asset
versions it is working with. The default sizes for these caches should
work fine for most builds; however, increasing the cache sizes may
speed up very large builds at the cost of increased memory usage. The
cache sizes are controlled by the file "misc.xml" which can be found
at "/gevol/assets/.config/misc.xml" (assuming your asset root is
"/gevol/assets"; if not, modify the path accordingly). The asset cache
size is controlled by "AssetCacheSize" and the asset version cache
size is controlled by "VersionCacheSize". Note that the asset version
cache is generally larger than the asset cache because it may contain
multiple versions of the same asset.

Within "misc.xml", the following options are deprecated and are
treated as if they are permanently enabled:
"DisablePacketLevelVersionCachePurge" and
"ConsolidateListenerNotifications".

Also included within "misc.xml" is an experimental option that allows
the user to limit the caches by memory usage instead of number of
objects. This option is controlled by "LimitMemoryUtilization" and its
default value is 0 (false). The maximum memory usage for each cache
can be set with "MaxAssetCacheMemorySize" and
"MaxVersionCacheMemorySize". This size is measured in bytes and the
default setting is 1GB. While this option is enabled, the caches will
not be limited by the number of objects in the cache. It should be
noted that as of now the reported memory usage is very low and that
this option is not recommended for production environments.

The Xerces library maintains a separate cache for dealing with XML
files. Users can modify aspects of this cache through a configuration
file at "/etc/opt/google/XMLparams". This file is not created
automatically as part of the Open GEE Fusion install, so users that
want to modify the parameters below must first create an "XMLparams"
file. The "XMLparams" file has the following format:

   # comments are preceded by '#'
   # options are case-insensitive, and all need not be present

   # the initial size of the XML heap in bytes
   # default is 16384
   INIT_HEAP_SIZE=<value>

   # the max size of the XML heap in bytes
   # default is 131072
   MAX_HEAP_SIZE=<value>

   # the size of XML heap allocation blocks in bytes
   # default is 4096
   BLOCK_SIZE=<value>

   # whether or not to purge the XML cache; valid values are 0 or 1
   # default is 1
   PURGE=<value>

   # the level at which to purge the XML cache; can be 1 (most often) to 5 (least often)
   # default is 3
   PURGE_LEVEL=<value>

-[ PackGen analysis thread configuration ]-

Within "misc.xml", there is an experimental feature for setting the
number of threads to use while analyzing and creating packgen tasks.
The number of threads is controlled by "PackGenAnalysisThreads". This
option is experimental and may contain bugs.

-[ Status request timeout ]-

Status requests to the system manager from clients like "getop" must
wait to be fulfilled if the system manager is already engaged in
another task. The system manager has a timeout that specifies the
maximum amount of time it should spend waiting to fulfill a status
request before it times out. This timeout can be configured manually
by setting "MutexTimedWaitSec" in "/gevol/assets/.config/misc.xml"

"<MutexTimedWaitSec>60</MutexTimedWaitSec>" .. rubric:: Improving
Performance

Included in "/gevol/assets/.config/misc.xml" is a "GraphOperations"
option, and it may be set to "1" (true) or "0" (false). This enables
optimized versions of certain operations. These options are
experimental and may contain bugs.
