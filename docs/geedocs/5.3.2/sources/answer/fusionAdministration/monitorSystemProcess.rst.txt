Monitor system processes

You can watch all active Google Earth Enterprise Fusion system tasks
and processes using the "getop" command. This command is similar to
the Unix command "top", but is specific to Google Earth Enterprise
Fusion processing. It is the command line equivalent to the System
Manager in the Google Earth Enterprise Fusion GUI. See

getop

 for more information.

The "getop" command outputs the following data for the workstation to
the console:

Version of Google Earth Enterprise Fusion running

Host name of the master

Currently selected asset root

The active process and maximum number of jobs allowed (max = n)

List of processes waiting to run

Process IDs, running time, and names of all Google Earth Enterprise
Fusion processes running

For example, the output might look something like this:
