If you want to customize certain aspects of the Google Earth
Enterprise Fusion GUI (such as menus, button labels, tables, lists,
etc.), you can use a graphical configuration tool called Qt
Configuration to customize the font size and other GUI features.

available options, and use the help text on the left side for help
with each tab.  The Qt Configuration tool is not a Google product. For
