      The Google Earth Enterprise installation script prompts you to
      enter information about your system and then properly configures
      your primary asset root and source volume. After you install
      Google Earth Enterprise Fusion, use the ``geconfigureassetroot``
      command to:

      -  **Add asset roots.**

         If you use the :doc:`../fusionTutorial/about`, Google recommends that
         you specify separate asset roots for each userâ€™s tutorial data
         and a completely different asset root for your real working
         data. See :doc:`../fusionTutorial/confTutorialWS` to learn how to configure
         and select an asset root for the tutorial, as well as how to
         clean up tutorial files.

      -  **Identify source volumes.**

         You must identify each directory that contains your source data
         files (or subdirectories of your source data files). Google
         Earth Enterprise Fusion is not able to read files located in
         other directories.

      -  **Modify the current volume.**

         You can modify volume definitions when migrating from a single-
         to a multiple-workstation configuration or when modifying the
         local path of a network-mounted source volume (for example,
         when adding a larger drive for source data).

      For more information on these commands, see
      :ref:`geconfigureassetroot <geconfigassetroot>`.

      .. container:: alert

         Do not modify the volume definition after you save data to that
         volume. Because the local name and the network path definitions
         are used by Google Earth Enterprise Fusion for resources,
         projects, and database definitions, any change to a volume
         definition invalidates the data already processed on that
         volume.

      If you add multiple asset roots, you can use the
      ``geselectassetroot`` to specify the volume in which you want to
      work and to switch back and forth among the available asset roots,
      if desired. For more information on these commands, see
      :ref:`geconfigureassetroot <geconfigassetroot>`.
