Backing up your data

Generally, the most important Google Earth Enterprise Server data is
all within the "/var" directory. If you perform regular backups of
"/var", that covers most of the server data. Google recommends that
you also back up the following directories:

   /etc
   /opt/google/gehttpd/conf
   /opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d
   /opt/google/getomcat/conf
   /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs

With regard to Google Earth Enterprise Fusion data, Google strongly
recommends that you back up all of your original source data (vector
and raster). In addition, Google encourages you to back up all of the
".xml" files within your asset root(s). In theory, if you have the
source data and the asset root ".xml" files, everything else can be
reconstructed. Google Earth Enterprise does not include any tools for
doing such a reconstruction, but the data is there and it could be
done, if necessary.

You do not need to back up your publish root(s), since there is
nothing there that cannot be recreated. If you have the space and want
to back them up, however, recovery will be faster, but it is not
necessary.

Many Google Earth Enterprise users also back up their product files.
These are the low-level files that result from building resources (for
example, ".kip", ".ktp", ".kmp", ".kvp"). That way, if you do need to
reconstruct, you can import the product files (rather than raw source
files) to recreate the resources. This will save you some build time.
