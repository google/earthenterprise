Back up Fusion servers

The Fusion server typically stores multiple terabytes of source data
and intermediate assets. If you have a tape backup system or enough
disk space, you should perform a full back up of the server any time a
new database is built or a significant amount of new data is
processed. If you do not have enough resources to do this, you can
back up only critical files and display rules instead.

-[ Display rules ]-

Typically, you will spend quite a bit of time defining display rules
exactly the way you want them, so you should back them up each time
you modify a vector layer.

To back up display rules:

In the Vector Layer dialog box, select Export as a Template.

Save the display rules on a volume different from the source volume
and the asset root.

-[ Critical Fusion files ]-

If you have backups of the files listed below, you can rebuild your
database with some patience and scripting. The rebuild will take a lot
of CPU time, but should go smoothly with a minimum of administrator
time.

The files that are critical to restoring your Fusion server are:

Your original source files. These are typically stored on a network
shared drive or on portable USB disks, depending on the environment.
Make sure that you can find and reload your original source files.

The XML files that Fusion generates during its processing. These are
critical because they contain the display rules for the vector data,
the rules for building resources and projects, and other critical
settings.

All the files under /opt/google/gehttpd in the cgi-bin, conf conf.d,
and htdocs directory. These files contain any user-customized scripts
or web pages, and the definitions of any virtual servers you created
on the Fusion server.

The files in the .config and .userdata directories under the asset
root. These contain custom icons and provider information as well as
some basic Fusion configuration settings.

-[ Backing up ]-

The steps below show you how to back up your critical files. When you
run these commands, replace the asset root and backup locations with
the locations of your own asset root and backups.

Make sure that you can locate and reload all the source data files if
needed.

Create a directory to hold the backup files:  mkdir -p
/data/backup/assets mkdir -p /data/backup/gehttpd

Back up the gehttpd files:  cd /opt/google/gehttpd rsync -r htdocs
cgi-bin conf conf.d /data/backup/gehttpd

Back up the XML files and config files to a safe place on a disk that
is not part of the asset root or source directories:  cd /gevol/assets
rsync -r .config .userdata /data/backup/assets/ find . -name "*.xml" >
FileList.txt rsync --files-from=FileList.txt /gevol/assets
/data/backup/assets/

(Optional.) Store a compressed backup of the files somewhere else:
tar czf /home/backups/GevolXmlBackup.tgz /data/backups

-[ Restoring imagery and terrain ]-

Make sure that the Fusion software is installed correctly and is
running.

Configure your asset root to be consistent with your old asset root.
If you are not sure about this, manually run commands like:
geconfigureassetroot --new --assetroot /gevol/assets geselectassetroot
--assetroot /gevol/assets

Restore the backed-up XML and configuration files to their original
location in the asset root.

Restore the source files to their original location on the Fusion
server. If you cannot remember the directory they were in, just place
them on the Fusion server in the source directory you specified in the
Fusion volume definitions (/gevol/src by default).

Use the gequery command and shell scripting to make sure your source
files are in the right place. If the files are not found, find them
and copy them to the right place. Below is an example of a script for
reporting where all your imagery source files should be located. You
can use the same script for terrain resources if you change kiasset to
ktasset. Example script:  cd /gevol/assets for resource in `find .
-type d -name "*.kiasset"` do    for file in `gequery --infiles
$resource`    do       if [ ! -f $file ] && [ ! -d $file ]       then
echo "Can not find $file"       else             echo "Found $file"
fi    done done

After all the files are in place, generate a series of commands to
rebuild the resources. For example:  cd /gevol/assets for resource in
`find . -type d -name "*.kiasset" | sed 's/.kiasset//'` do     gequery
--infiles $resource > filelist     genewimageryresource -o $resource
--filelist filelist     sleep 1     gebuild $resource done

There is a khasset.xml file under each .kiasset directory that
contains information about the mask tolerance, feathering, white fill,
and provider for each imagery and terrain resource. You can use
scripting to extract this information from each resource and add it to
the genewimageryresource command to apply the correct settings for
each resource.

-[ Restoring vectors ]-

The vector restore process is different from the imagery and terrain
process because of the display rules that each vector layer has. These
display rules take a very long time to configure, and typically the
Fusion administrator has not saved the display rules as a template.
Without the XML files, the vector project can take many hours to
recreate. Fortunately, all the display rules for each vector layer are
contained in a single file called "khasset.xml". This file is under
the vector project's main directory, and is included in the backup
script listed above. The "restore_vector_project.pl" file below reads
the khasset.xml file, and creates the commands and display templates
necessary to rebuild the entire vector project.

-[ restore_vector_project.pl ]-

   #!/usr/bin/perl
   #
