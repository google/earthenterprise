System Requirements for GEE Server

Hardware Requirements

   Minimum 2 dual-core Intel or AMD CPUs; 2.0 GHz or higher
   recommended.

   Minimum 4 GB RAM (8 GB RAM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux); 8 GB RAM
   (or more) per core recommended for Fusion.

   Minimum 500 GB of total hard disk storage.

   A graphics card with at least 64 MB video RAM (NVIDIA GeForce4 or
   higher preferred for Fusion GUI). You can install this graphics
   card in a separate workstation that accesses Fusion.

   Note: If you plan on cutting globes, this processing can be CPU-
     intensive and you may also need to plan on providing more storage
     depending on the size of the globes.

   Note on virtual machines

   : Fusion can be both CPU and I/O intensive. For optimal, stable
   performance, you should install it only on physical (non-virtual)
   machines. You can run GEE Server on a virtualized platform,
   provided the guest OS is one of our supported 64-bit distributions
   and you allocate sufficient resources to the VM.

Software Requirements

   Operating Systems

   OpenGEE is supported only on the 64-bit versions of the operating
   systems listed below.

   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x and 7.x, including the most recent
   security patches

   CentOS 6.x and 7.x

   Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS

   Browsers

   Google Earth Enterprise is supported on the following browsers on
   all operating systems:

   The latest version of Google Chrome

   The latest version of Mozilla Firefox

   However, Google Earth Enterprise should work with any modern
   browser.

   Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC)

   The following versions of Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) are
   recommended for use with Google Earth Enterprise:

   For GEE 5.x, use Google Earth EC version 7.0 or later

   For GEE 4.4, use Google Earth EC version 6.1 or later

   Note: Although older versions of Google Earth EC, i.e., 6.0 and
     earlier,

     may

      still connect to Google Earth Enterprise or Portable 3D
     databases, not all features will be available. Also, as Google
     Earth Enterprise has not been tested or certified against older
     versions of Google Earth EC, there may be unknown operational
     problems.

   Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) is supported on the following
   platforms:

   Windows

   Mac

   Linux

   Unsupported Versions and Environments

   There are many variations of operating systems and related
   software; point ("x.x") releases can sometimes contain changes that
   can impact your GEE installation. Although an unsupported version
   of these software packages may appear to function correctly, their
   use in a production environment is not recommended. Unexpected
   results may occur.

   Where possible, you should adhere to the hardware and software
   specifications listed in this document. If a problem arises in an
   unsupported configuration, we may not be able to help you resolve
   it.

Network Requirements

   Each destination server must meet the requirements below before you
   install GEE, and you must not change these settings after deploying
   GEE. The hostname must be the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of
   your destination server, e.g., "myserver.mydomainname.com".

   You can verify the hostname of your workstation by entering
   "hostname" at a shell prompt, and you can verify the network
   connection by using the "ping" command to reach other hosts in the
   same network. The requests should resolve using both an IP address
   and the FQDN.

   Hostname registered in DNS

   Hosts file is acceptable for small-scale systems

   Allocated IP addresses

   Correct network routing paths

   Network connectivity (Ports 80 and 22; Port 443 for HTTPS)

   Default installation of a Supported OS

   Java Development Kit or Runtime Environment (must download from
   Sun; use version 1.6.0_12 or newer)

   OpenSSL 0.9.8y (on OS media)

   Python 2.7.5 (on OS media)

   Storage for all source data and asset tree

   May be local storage (i.e., RAID 5 array)

   NAS storage via NFS acceptable

   SAN storage acceptable

   USB drive not recommended

Supported Configurations

   Google Earth Enterprise products are developed per the hardware and
   software requirements listed above. The products are intended to be
   installed according to the processes described in this
   documentation. When installing            Google Earth Enterprise
   in an unsupported environment, there are risks that the products
   may not operate as intended.

   Some factors that could affect your installation and deployment
   are:

   Installations on unsupported operating systems.

   Improperly configured DNS.

   Third party or non-default permissions or security measures (no
   root access, sudo blockers, etc.).

   Complex proxy configurations that prevent the network
   communications from operating as intended.

Important System Security Information

   We strongly recommend users who wish to host 3D and 2D globes
   online with Google Earth Enterprise follow industry standard
   security practices and review for their systems and networks before
   enabling access. Although we takes every precaution to secure the
   information, there is always the risk of unauthorized access
   outside of a closed or protected network.
