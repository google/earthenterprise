-[ Introduction ]-

You can customize or extend GEE Portable, or create applications that
work with it.

To help you get started, Google provides two "Hello World!" files that
you can copy and use as templates. These files ("Hello_Maps.html" for
2D maps and "Hello_Earth.html" for 3D globes) call the required
scripts, load the globe or map, define the ".css" file, and so on. The
files include JSON and, if needed, KML polygons.

See the resources linked to below to learn how to edit and extend the
"Hello_Maps.html" and "Hello_Earth.html" files.

Note: Clicking any of these links connects you to a site outside
  your network. If you are not sure if your organization allows
  outside connections, check with your administrator first.

"Hello_Maps.html" and "Hello_Earth.html" are based on the Google Maps
API and Google Earth API. More information about these APIs is linked
to below. Also included are links to some resources for learning how
to parse your JSON data and KML coordinates.

Google Maps API help at https://developers.google.com/maps/.  Examples
that use the Maps API.

Google Earth API help at https://developers.google.com/earth/.  The
Earth Plug-in and its API have been discontinued.

jQuery help at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/.  A method for
parsing JSON.

geoxml3 at https://code.google.com/p/geoxml3/.  A KML processor for
use with the Google Maps API.

-[ Hello Maps! ]-

To write a script to display portable 2D maps, start with
"hello_maps.html" and edit as needed. "hello_maps.html" is based on
the Google Maps API.

-[ To access the "hello_maps.html" file: ]-

Launch GEE Portable on localhost:9335.

Enter http://localhost:9335/local/preview/developers/hello_maps.html
in your browser.

View the page source. If you are not sure how to view the page source,
see your browser's help.

Hello Maps! code sample

-[ Hello Earth! ]-

To write a script to display portable 3D maps (globes), start with
"hello_earth.html" and edit as needed.

The ``hello_earth.html`` example is based on the discontinued Google
Earth API.

 Take that into consideration when developing new applications.

-[ To access the "Hello_Earth" file: ]-

Launch GME Portable on localhost:9335.

Enter http://localhost:9335/local/preview/developers/hello_earth.html
in your browser.

View the page source. If you are not sure how to view the page source,
see your browser's help.

-[ JSON documents ]-

Whenever your Portable instance is running, multiple JSON documents
are serving. The JSON finds information about all your available
globes and maps, as well as your current globe or map. Below are some
code snippets that show how the JSON works.

-[ Globes JSON example ]-

This code snippet is from the Globes JSON document, which provides
information about each available globe.

   Globes JSON: [yourhost]/?cmd=globes_info_json

   [ {  "name":"test.glb",
      "timestamp":"2013-01-01 12:00:00",
      "size":"20.00MB",
      "description":"Some globe description.",
      "path":"../../../../globes/test.glb",
      "is_gee":true,
      "is_2d":false,
      "is_3d":true,
      "has_polygon":true,
      "is_mercator":false,
      "is_being_served":false
      },
      {
      some other globe
      },...
   ]

-[ 2D JSON and 3D JSON examples ]-

The 2D and 3D JSON documents contain layer information as well as
information that helps the Search feature categorize the results.

If you are currently serving a map, 2D JSON will be serving:

"2D JSON: [yourhost]/query?request=Json&vars=geeServerDefs&is2d=t" If
you are currently serving a globe, 3D JSON will be serving:

"3D JSON: [yourhost]/query?request=Json&vars=geeServerDefs"

-[ Layer Definition examples ]-

Below are examples of layer definitions. The first is an imagery layer
and the second is a vector layer.

-[ Imagery layer example ]-

   [
   ...{
      icon : "icons/1.png",
      id : 1001,
      initialState : true,
      isPng : false,
      label : "Imagery",
      lookAt : "none",
      opacity : 1,
      requestType : "ImageryMaps", // A layer of imagery. version : 8
      }...
   ]

-[ Vector data example ]-

   [
   ...{
      icon : "icons/2.png",
      id : 1002,
      initialState : true,
      isPng : true,
      label : "Tokyo",
      lookAt : "none",
      opacity : 1,
      requestType : "VectorMapsRaster", // Vector data, such as roads, points, and borders. version : 4
   }...
   ]

-[ Polygon KML document ]-

Some globes also serve a KML file that contains polygon coordinates,
which define the initial display when the globe or map loads. Polygon
KML files also let Google Earth and Google Maps draw a polygon on the
globe or map. If a globe does not have any polygon data, the Polygon
KML file is empty.

-[ Polygon KML example ]-

This is an example of a KML document that contains a set of
coordinates that define the bounds of your globe's cut.
