Custom folders

By default, GEE Portable stores cut globes in the Apache Document root
of the GEE Server at "/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes".
However, you can move the portable globes folder to a custom location.
You might want to do this, for example, if this path is within a
volume with limited storage space and you have space available in a
separate volume.

-[ Before you begin ]-

Install and configure GEE Server on the machine that will support
users who create portable globes.

Identify the path to your globes folder. This can be the same mount
point for external storage of source data or the GEE Server Publish
Root.

Gain access to an account with root-level privileges.

-[ To create a custom globes folder: ]-

Make sure that no globe cutting operations are in progress. Creating a
custom folder makes modifications directly to the folder where
portable globes are hosted and can interfere with any ongoing globe
cutting operations.

Stop the GEE Server service:  sudo /etc/init.d/geserver stop

Use either of the methods below to set up your custom folder:  Create
a new folder:  mkdir /gevol/src/globes  Move the original folder to a
storage volume:  mv /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes
/gevol/src/globes

Create a symbolic link from the custom folder to the original folder
location:  ln -sf /gevol/src/globes
/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes

Change ownership of the custom folder to geapacheuser:gegroup and
change permissions to 755 (rwxr-wr-w):  chown -R geapacheuser:gegroup
/gevol/src/globes chmod -R 755 /gevol/src/globes

Start the GEE Server service.

To test that globe cutting works, load the GEE Globe Cutting web page
and either create a new portable globe or test with an existing globe.
If you have an existing globe, click List globes and maps directory in
the GEE Globe Cutting web page and make sure that your globe appears
there.
