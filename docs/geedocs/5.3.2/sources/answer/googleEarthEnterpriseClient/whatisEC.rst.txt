What is Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC)?

Open Google Earth Enterprise (Open GEE) lets organizations build and
host private globes created from their own geospatial data. Government
agencies and businesses can run Open GEE in their own data centers,
keeping their sensitive data behind the firewall with access
restricted to authorized employees.

Google Earth EC lets you view your organization’s private globes. To
host the globes, the database servers need to run the Google Earth
Enterprise Server software. Organizations can host globes on internal
servers only or can layer their data on top of Google’s global
database of satellite imagery and mapping information.

Google Earth EC is not part of the Open GEE project, and can be
downloaded separately
