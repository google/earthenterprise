Manage mosaics with virtual rasters

When you have large datasets of imagery or terrain resources,
importing them into Fusion can be inefficient and lead to gaps between
data tiles. GEE provides a tool, "gevirtualraster", which is ideal for
grouping blocks (or subsets) of contiguous imagery or terrain and
creating a

virtual mosaic

 from them.

In the following example, this SRTM 90meter terrain dataset has over
14,476 source files.


This example of a large set of terrain data presents three potential
ways to import all large datasets of source files:

Create one resource for all source .tif tiles. This data processing is
inefficient as Fusion must fill all missing data between source
terrain tiles (oceans).

Create one terrain resource per .tif file (14,476 in total). This data
processing is inefficient and introduces feather gaps between terrain
resources due to no overlap between source files.

Group the 14,476 files into virtual mosaics enabling you to select
which files are grouped into mosaics.

The most efficient method of grouping tiles into virtual mosaics is to
use "gevirtualraster", a command line tool that lets you access the
tile groups directly, making your mosaic management very flexible.
"Gevirtualraster" validates that each source file has geographic
coordinates and that all files are consistent projections, number of
bands, and band formats.

-[ Overview ]-

A

virtual mosaic

 or virtual raster file is a simple text file that describes a mosaic
of peer raster files with the following elements:

Projection parameters (all peers with same projection)

Coordinate location of the overall raster (sum of parts)

Pixel dimensions

Band count and format (3 x 8 bit vs. 1 x 8 bit)

File path of all included source files

Fusion can display the virtual raster file in

Preview

 for simple visualization.

Fusion can also use the virtual raster file as source.

Note: "Gevirtualraster" is necessary if you are creating a custom
  mask file for the imagery or terrain resource as there is a software
  requirement of one source file for one custom mask file. See

  Create custom masks

  .

-[ Example Usage ]-

This end-to-end example uses "gevirtualraster" to create a new Fusion
resource from a set of 800+ contiguous imagery resources (jpeg2000)
with consistent pixel size, projection, etc.

List the jpeg2000 files that are to be used for the virtual mosaic:  $
ls -l *.tif | wc -l  863

Create a virtual raster file, specifiying the fill value to be used
for the mosaic (0, 0, 0 = black), the name of the file to be generated
(my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.khvr), and include all of the .tif files
in the current folder as input.  $ gevirtualraster --fill 0,0,0
--tolerance 3 -o my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.khvr *.tif

Import the virtual raster imagery file into Fusion, specifying the
resource type, the virtual raster file to import and the output
resource file, $ my_virtualmosaic_20140624.kip.  $ gerasterimport
--imagery my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.khvr -o
my_virtualmosaic_20140624.kip

Create a mask for the imagery resource, specifying band, fill,
tolerance and feather values, the imagery resource file and the name
of the mask created.  $ gemaskgen --mask --band 1 --fill 0 --tolerance
3 --feather 100   my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.kip
my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1-mask.tif

Import the generated alpha mask, creating a .kmp folder. Corresponding
.kip and .kmp folders should be stored in the same directory.  $
gerasterimport --alphamask my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1-mask.tif
--imagery   my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.kip --output
my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.kmp

Define a new imagery resource.  $ genewimageryresource -o
Resources/Imagery/candid_my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1   /gevol/src/can
did/my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1/my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1.kip

Build the new imagery resource.  $ gebuild
Resources/Imagery/candid_my_virtualmosaic_20140624_1

-[ Creating a virtual raster from a file list ]-

You can create a virtual raster of all source files stored in a test
file using the "gevirtualraster --filelist" option:

   $ gevirtualraster --fill 0,0,0 -o /gevol/src/imagery/example/example-mosaic-list.khvr
     --filelist /gevol/src/imagery/example/source-files.txt

The file list must include one column of file names and the full path
of each source file must be included in the file list.

-[ gevirtualraster command line options ]-

Various options are available to facilitate the creation of virtual
raster files, including specifying the band values to be used as fill,
tolerance values for the fill, and a file list of the source imagery
or terrain files.

   $ gevirtualraster [--crop pixelx,pixely,pixelx,pixelh] [--fill a,b,...] [--src override_srs]
     [--tolerance num] [--validate] -o output.khvr {sourcefile ... | --filelist file}

-[ Example ]-

   $ gevirtualraster --fill 0,0,0 -o /gevol/src/imagery/usa/XX/new_location/all_files.khvr
     /gevol/src/imagery/usa/XX/new_location/*.tif

-[ Parameters ]-

    Option  Description  --crop pixelx,pixely,pixelx,pixelh  Optional.
Crop the image to the specified pixel extents.  --fill a,b,...
Optional. Specify band values to use as fill.  --src override_srs
Optional. Specify the SRS.  --tolerance num  Optional. Specify the
tolerance to be applied to the fill. The default is 0.  --validate
Optional. Validate the inputs and exit.  -o output.khvr  Required.
Specify the name of the output file, which must have the .khvr
extension.  sourcefile  Required. Specify the path and file name of
the source file for the resource. You can reference any network-
available source file as this value. (Optional if you specify
--filelist file.)  --filelist file  Optional. Specify the path and
file name of a file that contains a list of source files that you want
to include in the resource. You can use this option, list files
individually, or use a combination of the two.

-[ Splitting large virtual raster mosaics ]-

If you create larger virtual raster mosaics, you may want to split
them into smaller subsets. You can use the "gesplitkhvr" command line
tool to automatically split large ".khvr" mosaics into subsets by
specifying the number of rows and columns.

"gesplitkhvr [--rows num] [--cols num] [--overlap num] [--quiet]
input.khvr"

The "gesplitkhvr" command creates two or more source files from a
large imagery or terrain source file to reduce the size of each source
file to under 80 GB in raw size. (Raw size = number of pixels width *
number of pixels height * 3.) This tool produces a grid of image files
designated as rows and columns.

-[ Example ]-

"gesplitkhvr --rows 4 --cols 4 --overlap 10 image_file.khvr"

-[ Parameters ]-

    Option  Description  --rows num  Required. Specify the number of
resulting image files across.  --cols num  Required. Specify the
number of resulting image files high.  --overlap num  Optional.
Specify the number of pixels of overlap between the resulting images.
The default is 300.  --quiet  Optional. Do not display the progress
messages in the terminal window.  input.khvr  Required. Specify the
name of the input file. It must be a .khvr file.
