Map buttons

If you are using version 2.x of the Maps JavaScript API, the procedure
below explains how to create map buttons for GEE. However, this
procedure is not compatible with Maps API 3.x.

GEE includes a default web interface for viewing 2D maps that you
build with Fusion and host on a GEE 2D virtual server. In the example
below, the left panel shows map layers that are published with the
database.

The default interface does not include layer buttons like the “Maps,
Satellite, Hybrid” buttons in Google Maps. However, you can do some
HTML and JavaScript editing to display Maps, Imagery, and Hybrid layer
buttons that are similar. The example map below displays a

Maps

 button for its two map layers and an

Imagery

 button for its imagery layer.

To create buttons like this, associate the

Maps

,

Imagery

, and

Hybrid

 (

Show Labels

) buttons with map types that you define with "GMapType". In Google
Maps, map types are constants that can be called directly. However, in
GEE you need to use "GMapType" to define map types in the interface
itself because the map and imagery layers are different for each map.

-[ To define map types in GEE: ]-

Use GFusionTileLayer to define a new tile layer for each map or
imagery layer. GFusionTileLayer can directly reference the array where
the map and imagery layers are stored.

Pass these two constructors to the GFusionTileLayer class:  The URL of
the hosting server.  The layer definition. The definition includes
information like the version of the tiles, the channel ID number, and
whether the tiles are in PNG format.

Specify which layer in the geeServerDefs array to select for each
GFusionTileLayer object.  The imagery layer is layer 0.  The maps
layer is layer 1.  The hybrid (Show Labels) layer is layer 2.  var
imagery_map_layer = new GFusionTileLayer(geeServerDefs.serverUrl,
geeServerDefs.layers[0]); var painted_map_layer = new
GFusionTileLayer(geeServerDefs.serverUrl, geeServerDefs.layers[1]);
var labels_layer = new GFusionTileLayer(geeServerDefs.serverUrl,
geeServerDefs.layers[2]);  You can access the server definitions and
other information about map and imagery layers directly from a web
browser by using a URL in this format: http://yourserver.org/virtual-
server-name/query?request=Json&vars=geeServerDefs. Responses will look
like the image below:  GEE server definitions  This data can also be
returned by using the optional v parameter.  v=1 returns the data in
the format shown in the image above.  v=2 returns the data in the JSON
format.  A query without the v parameter acts as v=1.  An example of a
query using the v parameter: http://<GEE earth
server>/<database_publish_point>/query?request=Json&v=2

Associate layers with buttons by using the GMapType class to define a
map type for each of the GTileLayer objects. See the example below:
var painted_map_type = new GMapType([painted_map_layer],new
LatLngProjection(MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL),"Maps"); var imagery_map_type = new
GMapType([imagery_map_layer],new
LatLngProjection(MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL),"Imagery"); var labels_map_type = new
GMapType([imagery_map_layer, labels_layer],new
LatLngProjection(MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL),"Hybrid");

Use the .addMapControl() method to add each map type and its
associated button to the map:  map.addMapType(painted_map_type);
map.addMapType(imagery_map_type); map.addMapType(labels_map_type);

Remove the predefined Google Maps map types below so that the buttons
display correctly:  map.removeMapType(G_SATELLITE_MAP); // Remove the
default  Satellite Map Type button  map.removeMapType(G_HYBRID_MAP);
// Remove the default  Hybrid Map Type button
map.removeMapType(G_NORMAL_MAP); // Remove the default  Map Type
button

Add controls (like the zoom bar, the navigation bar, an overview map,
and zooming options) to the map:  map.addControl(new
GSmallMapControl()); map.addControl(new GOverviewMapControl());
map.addControl(new GScaleControl()); map.enableScrollWheelZoom();
map.enableContinuousZoom();

-[ Display a drop-down menu instead of buttons ]-

You can show a drop-down menu for the map layers instead of the side-
by-side buttons, as shown below.

    Standard map type buttons  Drop-down menu for map types  Map
buttons  Menu buttons

To accomplish this, replace the "GHierarchicalMapTypeControl" call
with a "GMenuMapTypeControl".

-[ Maintenance considerations ]-

The layer ordering in "geeServerDefs" changes for each new version, so
if you add more map layers or reorder the existing map layers in the
2D Map Database after you implement the HTML page, you must also
update your "GFusionTileLayer" definitions so that the GEE Server
requests the correct layer.

-[ Make the HTML example the default display ]-

You can set the example HTML file as the default view by changing one
of the settings in the server configuration file. See below for an
example of a location-based 2D virtual server configuration file.

In this example, the server is hosted at

"http://machine123.company.internal/mapexample -
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/virtual_servers/example.location".

   # The mapexample virtual server
   RewriteRule ^/mapexample$ /mapexample/ [R]
   RewriteRule ^/mapexample/+$ /maps/maps_local.html [PT]
   RewriteRule ^/mapexample/+maps/+mapfiles/(.*)$ /maps/mapfiles/$1 [PT]
   <Location "/mapexample/*">
   SetHandler gedb-handler Include conf.d/virtual_servers/runtime/example_runtime
   </Location>

In the example above, the second RewriteRule specifies that the
"/maps/maps_local.html" web page is loaded whenever users visit the
virtual server URL "http://machine123.company.internal/mapexample".

You can change this setting to load a different web page:

   # The mapexample virtual server
   RewriteRule ^/mapexample$ /mapexample/ [R]
   RewriteRule ^/mapexample/+$ /maps/gmaps_buttons.html [PT]
   RewriteRule ^/mapexample/+maps/+mapfiles/(.*)$ /maps/mapfiles/$1 [PT]
   <Location "/mapexample/*">
   SetHandler gedb-handler Include conf.d/virtual_servers/runtime/example_runtime
   </Location>

After you make changes to the file, restart the GEE Server to reload
the configuration file and implement the change.

-[ Access the imagery tiles hosted from another GEE 2D virtual server
]-

You can use the "GTileLayer" Maps API class to access the web page for
imagery layers that are published from different GEE servers. Then you
can follow the same instructions above to assign the layer to a custom
map type and display a button for it on your map.

-[ Data used to build the map and imagery tiles ]-

-[ Map data ]-

You can obtain a complete copy of the 2D Map layer display rules from
the

Google Earth Enterprise

 Google Group Files section. The maps and hybrid (Show Labels) map
layers were built from three different datasets:

Global borders (filled and outlined) in the maps and hybrid layers
were created from the the Thematic Mapping World Borders dataset,
available under a Creative Commons license at
http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.ph

USA state boundaries in the maps and hybrid layers were created from
the USA State borders vector data hosted by the National Atlas of the
USA (now called the National Map). You can download state boundaries
from https://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/atlasftp.html.

The background water that is visible in the maps layer was created
with a global KML file. You can obtain the KML water file from the
Google Earth Enterprise Google Group Files section.

-[ Imagery data ]-

Imagery for the globe was built from two different sources:

BlueMarble 500-meter global imagery (combined surface and bathymetric
imagery) was used as the backdrop for the image.

A reduced resolution (120-meter) version of imagery from the Premium
Globe dataset was used for land imagery.
