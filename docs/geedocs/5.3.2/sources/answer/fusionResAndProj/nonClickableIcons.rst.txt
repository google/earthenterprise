Non-clickable icons

By default, any point icon that you configure in Fusion displays a
pop-up balloon whenever EC users click it. You can configure the pop-
up balloons to display information about the point. An example is
shown below.

However, if you do not want an icon to display a pop-up balloon, you
can use one of Fusion's

Advanced

 options to make it a non-clickable icon. (Non-clickable icons are
point icons that do not change when clicked.)

below, the point vector resource is called USA_Cities.  Point layer
