      .. rubric:: Description

      When you try to publish a database, the network connection to the
      server is down or permissions are set incorrectly on the target
      server.

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      Check your network connections and make sure that the targeted
      server is running and accessible. Check the access permissions in
      the publishing root directory. Check the GEE Server logs.
