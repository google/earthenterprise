Client too old

-[ Error message ]-

"Invalid protocol version (client too old)"

-[ Description ]-

During the initial transition from tools that do not check for
matching versions to the versions that do check (e.g., from 2.4.x to
3.x), you tried to use an old version of the Fusion GUI or command
line to connect to a new version of the system manager.

-[ Resolution ]-

Ensure that you are using the same version of Fusion and GEE Server.
