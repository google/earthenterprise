Unable to find a suitable resource provider

-[ Error message ]-

"Unable to find a suitable resource provider: no CPU(s) is available
to start the task <task_name>"

-[ Description ]-

This error typically occurs when the system is building and no more
CPUs are available for the build task. This error can also occur if
there are fewer CPUs (maximum number of concurrent tasks/jobs)
assigned to Fusion (specifically, to a Fusion machine, also called a
"geresourceprovider") than the minimum CPU setting for a task rule.

-[ Resolution ]-

In response to the error, you can do one of the following:

Wait for the other build or task to finish.

Assign more CPUs (maximum number of concurrent tasks/jobs) to Fusion.
You can use the tool geselectassetroot --assetroot path --numcpus to
assign more CPUs. For example:  geselectassetroot --assetroot
/gevol/assets --numcpus 8

If the task can complete with fewer CPUs, decrease the minimum CPU
setting for the task rule.
