Pushing, Publishing, and Viewing a Database
===========================================

      Pushing a database is the process of making a Google Earth
      Enterprise Fusion database available on a Google Earth Enterprise
      Server so that it can then be published for viewing with Google
      Earth EC.

      The *push* operation copies all the necessary files associated
      with a given 2D/3D Fusion database version to Google Earth
      Enterprise Server and registers the database. Pushing is performed
      from Fusion.

      The *publish* operation makes a previously pushed database
      available for serving at a specified publish point. Publishing is
      performed on Google Earth Enterprise Server.

      .. note::

         **Note:** This lesson assumes that Google Earth Enterprise
         Fusion, the Google Earth Enterprise Server, and Google Earth EC
         are all installed on your local workstation. If any of these
         applications are installed elsewhere on your network, adjust
         the instructions in this lesson accordingly.

      .. note::

         **Note:** This lesson describes the steps for pushing a 3D
         Fusion database. The same workflow is used to push a 2D
         Mercator database, but note that snippet profiles do not apply
         and that the published map can be viewed in a web browser, not
         Google Earth EC. See :doc:`../fusionTutorial/createMapDB` for more information.

      .. _Push_Your_Database:
      .. rubric:: Push Your Database to Google Earth Enterprise Server
         :name: push-your-database-to-google-earth-enterprise-server

      After you define and build your database, you “push” your database
      to Google Earth Enterprise Server. Pushed databases appear on the
      Databases page of the Google Earth Enterprise Server Admin
      console, from which you can then publish them.

      .. rubric:: To push a database:
         :name: to-push-a-database

      #. Select **Asset Manager** from the **Tools** menu. The Asset Manager
         appears.
      #. Navigate to the **SFHighways** database you built in :doc:`../fusionTutorial/buildDatabase`.
      #. Right-click the name of the database, and select **Push** from
         the context menu.

         The Push Database dialog appears. The default server
         association is the only option on the Server Associations
         drop-down list. The most recent version of the selected
         database is the default selection on the **Version** drop-down
         list.

         |Push Database Dialog|

      #. Click the **Push** button. Google Earth Enterprise Fusion pushes the
         database to Google Earth Enterprise Server, and displays a
         success message when it is done.

         **Note:** If you get an error message, contact your Google
         Earth Enterprise Server administrator for help, or check the
         documentation on :doc:`../fusionAdministration/beforeYouConfigure` for more
         information.

      .. _Publish_Your_Database:
      .. rubric:: Publish Your Database in Google Earth Enterprise
         Server
         :name: publish-your-database-in-google-earth-enterprise-server

      After you push your database to Google Earth Enterprise Server,
      you can publish it for viewing with Google Earth EC.

      .. rubric:: To publish a database:
         :name: to-publish-a-database

      #. Access the Google Earth Enterprise Server Admin console in a
         browser window by going to *myserver.mydomainname*.com/admin,
         replacing *myserver* and *mydomainname* with your server and
         domain.
      #. Sign in with the default credentials or the username and
         password assigned to you:

         -  Default username: geapacheuser
         -  Default password:geeadmin

         **Note:** If you do not know your username and password,
         contact your Google Earth Enterprise Server System
         Administrator.

      #. Click **Databases** to display the list of databases pushed to
         the Server.

         SFHighways-v001 is listed. The Description, Type, Date, and
         Size of the database are also noted.

         |GEE Server Database Page|

      #. Check the box next to SFHighways-v001. The **Publish** button
         on the Databases page appears.

         |GEE Server Database Publish|

      #. Click **Publish**. The Publish dialog appears.
      #. Change the default **Publish point** from SFHighways-v001 to
         **BayAreaHighways**.

         |GEE Server Database Publish dialog|

         .. note::

            **Note:** You can publish a database to *multiple publish
            points*, useful when you want to apply different search
            tabs, snippet profiles, and virtual host settings for
            different viewing needs.

         .. note::

            **Note:** When publishing a database, the publish point you
            specify is case-*insensitive*. Upper and lower case are not
            differentiated. Make sure each publish point path name you
            specify is unique.

         To learn more about the options available in the Publish
         dialog, see :doc:`../geeServerAdmin/createSearchTabs`,
         :doc:`Snippet profiles <../geeServerAdmin/manageSnippetProfiles>`, and
         :doc:`WMS <../geeServerAdmin/makeWMSRequests>`.

      #. Click the **Publish**  button. The Databases page updates to indicate the
         published status of your database.

      .. _View_Your_Database:
      .. rubric:: View Your Database
         :name: view-your-database

      After you publish your database, you can view it in Google Earth
      EC. Google Earth EC can be downloaded from
      `here <https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/wiki/Google-Earth-Enterprise-Client-(EC)>`_.

      .. rubric:: To view your database:
         :name: to-view-your-database-2

      #. Launch Google Earth EC.

         The Login dialog appears.

      #. Specify the Publish point by entering or selecting the URL or
         IP address of your server and database in the **Server** field. For
         this tutorial, the Publish point is
         *myserver.mydomainname*.com/BayAreaHighways, where *myserver*
         and *mydomainname* are specific to your server. An example URL
         would be http://myhostname/BayAreaHighways.
      #. Click the **Sign In** button.
      #. Double-click **CAHighways** to zoom in to your road data.
