         The Google Earth Plug-in is deprecated and is no longer
         available for download. This page is only applicable if you
         have a copy of the Google Earth Plug-in from a previous
         relationship with Google.

      If your users want to connect to GEE Server and view
      databases in a browser, they must install the Google Earth
      Plug-in. They must also use a browser that supports NPAPI, which
      excludes most modern browsers. If they do not already have the
      plug-in, you can provide the installer so that the plug-in
      downloads when they attempt to connect to GEE Server.

      The plug-in installer should be placed in the following directory
      on **GEE Server**:

      ``/opt/google/gethttpd/htdocs/earth/plugin``

      The directory includes ``install.html``, a landing page from which
      the installers are launched. When a user attempts to connect
      without the plug-in installed, they are automatically directed
      here from earth_local.html's default error page. There are two
      installers, which should be renamed as follows:

      -  ``/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/earth/plugin/GoogleEarth-Mac-Plugin-Latest.dmg``
      -  ``/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/earth/plugin/GoogleEarth-Windows-Plugin-Latest.msi``

      These installers do not require administrative rights on the
      user's machine. They also do not auto-update. If users are unable
      to download the installer from this location, they should contact
      their system administrator.

      .. tip::

         The Google Earth Plug-in installer for Windows requires
         administrative rights when installing to Internet Explorer.
