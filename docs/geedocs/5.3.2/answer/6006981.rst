      .. rubric:: What is Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC)?

      Open Google Earth Enterprise (OpenGEE) lets organizations build
      and host private globes created from their own geospatial data.
      Government agencies and businesses can run OpenGEE in their own
      data centers, keeping their sensitive data behind the firewall
      with access restricted to authorized employees.

      Google Earth EC lets you view your organization’s private globes.
      To host the globes, the database servers need to run the Google
      Earth Enterprise Server software. Organizations can host globes on
      internal servers only or can layer their data on top of Google’s
      global database of satellite imagery and mapping information.

      Google Earth EC is not part of the OpenGEE project, and can be
      downloaded separately from
      `here. <https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/wiki/Google-Earth-Enterprise-Client-(EC)>`_
