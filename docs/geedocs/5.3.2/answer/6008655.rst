      .. rubric:: Running Fusion on a Machine with Multiple CPUs

      Fusion can be configured to use a maximum number of CPUs on a
      machine with the following command:

      ``/opt/google/bin/geselectassetroot --assetroot /my/assetroot --numcpus X``
      This number will show up as the maxjobs entry within getop output
      and corresponds to how many concurrent jobs Fusion may spawn at
      any one time. Note that the value for --numcpus should be equal
      to, or less than, the number of physical CPU cores on the machine.

      Each task within Fusion is configured to use 1 CPU by default.
      Changing the maximum number of CPUs using the above command will
      not affect the number of CPUs assigned to each individual task.
      Some tasks in Fusion are capable of multithreaded support
      including:

      -  gepackgen (imagery and terrain projects)
      -  gemaptilegen (2D vector-based map tiles)
      -  gecombineterrain (3D databases)

      These tasks may be multithreaded by enabling *task rules* within
      Fusion. Implementation of task rules is described in more detail
      in :doc:`176738`.

      The **ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule**,
      **TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule**, **MapLayerLevel.taskrule**, and
      **CombinedTerrain.taskrule** task rules enable multiple CPUs to
      work on each individual task. For example, configuring a
      ``minNumCPUs`` and ``maxNumCPUs`` of two for the
      **ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule** means that up to four gepackgen
      processes may run on Fusion when eight CPU cores are allocated.

      As a best practice, **ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule**,
      **TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule** and **MapLayerLevel.taskrule**
      should be configured such that multiple gepackgen and gemaptilegen
      processes can run concurrently.

      Since ``gecombineterrain`` is CPU-intensive and can be an
      operational bottleneck, more CPUs should be assigned to that task
      to expedite processing. So on a machine with **eight** CPU cores available
      for Fusion processing:

      #. Set
         ``/opt/google/bin/geselectassetroot --assetroot /my/assetroot --numcpus=7``.
         It's recommended to set the maximum number of CPUs allocated to
         Fusion to **(N-1)**, such that one CPU core is reserved for system
         operations.
      #. Set ``minNumCPU=2`` and ``maxNumCPU=2`` in
         **ImageryPacketLevel.taskrule** for imagery projects (**three**
         concurrent ``gepackgen`` tasks possible).*\*
      #. Set ``minNumCPU=3`` and ``maxNumCPU=4`` in
         **TerrainPacketLevel.taskrule** for terrain projects (**two**
         concurrent ``gepackgen`` tasks possible)*\*
      #. Set ``minNumCPU=3`` and ``maxNumCPU=4`` in
         **MapLayerLevel.taskrule** (**two** concurrent ``gemaptilegen`` jobs
         possible).
      #. Set ``minNumCPU=7`` and ``maxNumCPU=7`` in
         **CombinedTerrain.taskrule** (**one** ``gecombineterrain`` task)

         .. note::

            **Note:** \**Fusion will use up to 200% CPU processing for
            imagery projects per ``gepackgen`` process, and up to 400%
            CPU processing for terrain projects. There is fundamentally
            a balance between assigning sufficient numbers of CPUs to
            each individual process for ``gepackgen`` while still
            enabling multiple concurrent ``gepackgen`` processes for
            parallel processing.

         All other tasks in Fusion will continue to operate with min/max
         one CPU.
