      User behavior dramatically influences bandwidth requirements.
      However, even with a good set of log files, bandwidth usage for
      Google Earth is difficult to measure. When assessing how much
      bandwidth you need, keep in mind the following considerations:

      -  Google Earth servers use HTTP, which is inherently stateless.
         This means that it is very difficult to measure concurrent users
         because it is not clear when users log out of the client or when
         users move to another application and leave the client running.
      -  The Google Earth client has a local cache, so after a user has
         visited one area on the globe, those tiles are not re-requested
         from the server. Consequently, bandwidth usage is affected by
         the size of the local cache and how often users revisit areas.
      -  User traffic comes in bursts, not a steady stream. When a
         client flies to a new location, the new set of tiles are sent
         to the client, causing a spike in traffic. After the client
         stops in one place, traffic goes to zero. You should set
         bandwidth requirements high enough to accommodate spikes in
         usage.
