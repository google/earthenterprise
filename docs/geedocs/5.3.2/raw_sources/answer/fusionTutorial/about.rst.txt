      Google Earth Enterprise Fusion is designed for organizations that
      want to display their own geospatial data in Google Earth and
      Google Maps. You can use it to create graphically rich geographic
      information system (GIS) databases for distribution to your
      customers or in-house end users. With Google Earth Enterprise
      Fusion, you can integrate your own geospatial data, publish it to
      the Google Earth Enterprise Server, and view it using Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC), the Google Maps API, or the Google Earth
      API.

      Before you begin working with real data in Google Earth Enterprise
      Fusion, it is important for you to familiarize yourself with the
      process of defining and building different types of data. This
      tutorial provides a series of exercises that you can perform in an
      environment where it is all right to make mistakes. Once you start
      working with real data, it will be more difficult to correct
      mistakes, so please take your time working through the tutorial
      until you feel comfortable with Google Earth Enterprise Fusion.

      The Basic Tasks section of this tutorial guides you through
      building a Google Earth Enterprise Fusion database from raw source
      material and publishing it using the Google Earth Enterprise
      Server, using the tutorial files provided on the Google Earth
      Enterprise Fusion installation DVD.

      .. note::

         Work through the first five lessons in order.

      The Advanced Tasks section of this tutorial guides you through
      more advanced topics. You can work through the advanced lessons in
      any order you wish. Alternatively, you can skip the Advanced Tasks
      section until you want to learn about something new. Then, you can
      come back to the tutorial and work through the lessons of your
      choice.

      .. rubric:: Audience
         :name: audience

      This guide is intended for individuals who are new to Google Earth
      Enterprise Fusion. It assumes that you have some familiarity with
      GIS data and have used a Google Earth client, but have no
      familiarity with this application. It also assumes that Google
      Earth Enterprise Fusion, the Google Earth Enterprise Server, and
      Google Earth EC have been installed either on a network drive
      accessible to you or on your local workstation. If any of those
      three applications are not installed, contact your system
      administrator or refer to :doc:`../installGEE/installOverviewGEE`.
