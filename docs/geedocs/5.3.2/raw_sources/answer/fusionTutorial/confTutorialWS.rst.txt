Configure Tutorial Workspace
============================

   .. container:: content

      To accommodate users who are working through the tutorial at the
      same time as other users (or even those same users) are working on
      production data, Google recommends that you configure a tutorial
      workspace on each workstation where you install the tutorial
      data. That way, you can keep the tutorial source volume and asset
      root separate from your production source volume(s) and asset
      root.

      This article describes how to configure the tutorial workspace
      and how to switch back and forth between the tutorial asset root
      and the production asset root. You will also learn how to clean up the
      tutorial files when they are no longer needed.

      .. _Download_Tutorial_Source:
      .. rubric:: Download the Tutorial Source Files

      The tutorial source files are available in the following archives.
      It can be downloaded all together, or for convenience it can be
      downloaded in two parts.

      -  `FusionTutorial-Full.tar.gz <http://data.opengee.org/FusionTutorial-Full.tar.gz>`__
         [`md5 <http://data.opengee.org/FusionTutorial-Full.tar.gz.md5>`__]
         - Contains all the source data needed to complete the tutorial
         - 600 MB
      -  `FusionTutorial-NoMosaicImagery.tar.gz <http://data.opengee.org/FusionTutorial-NoMosaicImagery.tar.gz>`__
         [`md5 <http://data.opengee.org/FusionTutorial-NoMosaicImagery.tar.gz.md5>`__]
         - Contains all the source data needed to complete the tutorial,
         except for the Mosaic section - 282 MB
      -  `FusionTutorial-Imagery-mosaic.tar.gz <http://data.opengee.org/FusionTutorial-Imagery-mosaic.tar.gz>`__
         [`md5 <http://data.opengee.org/FusionTutorial-Imagery-mosaic.tar.gz.md5>`__]
         - Contains only the souce data needed to complete the Mosaic
         section of the tutorial - 318 MB

      Once the source files are downloaded, as root, create the
      ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion`` directory if it doesn't
      exist. Extract each archive downloaded to that location. Be sure
      all the files have read permission for all users and directories
      have read and execute permission for all users.

      .. note::

         Due to a bug in the current Google Earth Enterprise Open
         Source version, vector source files also need the write
         permission.

      .. _Configuring_Tutorial_Asset_Root:
      .. rubric:: Configuring the tutorial asset root and source volume

      When you install Google Earth Enterprise, you configure a source
      volume and asset root for your production data. If you accepted
      the default values, they are ``/gevol/src`` and ``/gevol/assets``,
      respectively.

      The installation script installs the tutorial files in
      ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion``, so you must add that path
      as the source volume for the tutorial. In addition, Google
      recommends that you add a tutorial asset root for users to store
      the data they create with Google Earth Enterprise Fusion while
      working through the tutorial.

      The following procedure describes how to configure an asset root
      and the tutorial source volume for each tutorial user. You must
      configure them for *each* user on *each* workstation where you
      install the Google Earth Enterprise Fusion tutorial files.

      .. rubric:: To configure a tutorial asset root and source volume:
         :name: to-configure-a-tutorial-asset-root-and-source-volume

      #. On the command line, log in as root.
      #. Stop the system manager by entering:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion stop``

      #. Enter:

         ``geconfigureassetroot --new --assetroot /username/assets``

         where *username* is the name of the user.

         The *username* does not have to be the user’s official account
         name. It can be anything that distinguishes that user from
         other users on that particular workstation, such as
         ``edaniels`` or just ``Emily``.

         .. note::

            Google recommends that you place the tutorial asset
            root on the same partition as the publish root, so the
            publisher uses hard links instead of making copies of the
            tutorial databases.

            If you place the tutorial asset root on the root partition,
            ensure that there is enough disk space for the data created by
            each user working through the tutorial. If a user completes all
            lessons in the tutorial, allow 1.5 GB of disk space.

         The tool asks if you want to create a new source volume.

      #. Enter **Y**, and press **Enter**.

         You are prompted to enter a directory for the source volume.

      #. Enter ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion``, and press
         **Enter**.

         The tool asks if you want to add more volumes.

      #. If you want to create tutorial workspaces for more users,
         enter **Y**, press **Enter**, and repeat steps **3** through
         **5**. If not, skip this step. Otherwise, enter **N**, and
         press **Enter**.

         The tool displays the message “Configured
         ``/``\ *username*\ ``/assets``\ ” and returns you to the
         command line prompt.

      #. Log out as root.
      #. Start the system manager by entering:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion start``

         .. note::

            The new source volume and asset root are
            automatically selected for you. You do not have to run the
            ``geselectassetroot`` command. (See the next section, :ref:`Select
            the Tutorial Asset Root <Select_Tutorial_Asset_Root>`, for
            more information about selecting different asset roots.)

      .. _Select_Tutorial_Asset_Root:
      .. rubric:: Select the tutorial asset root

      There are two occasions when users must select a different asset
      root:

      -  When multiple users share a single workstation, each user must
         select his or her own tutorial asset root.
      -  When a user switches from the tutorial data to real production
         data, he or she must select the appropriate asset root.

      This section explains how to select a different asset root.

      **Caution:** Note that even though your source volumes and asset
      roots are separate for each user or for the tutorial and
      production data, there is only one publish root on each virtual
      server for Earth databases and one for Map databases.

      When two users are sharing a single workstation, they are both
      publishing to the same publish root. When one user publishes a
      database on that workstation, it overwrites any database published
      previously by another user on that same workstation. Likewise, if
      a user is switching back and forth between tutorial and production
      data on the same workstation, it is possible to overwrite a production
      database with a tutorial database and vice versa. Of course, the
      user can simply republish the desired database to make it available
      to Google Earth EC again.

      .. rubric:: To select the tutorial asset root:
         :name: to-select-the-tutorial-asset-root

      #. On the command line, log in as root.
      #. Stop the system manager by entering:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion stop``

      #. Enter:

         ``geselectassetroot --assetroot /username/assets``

         where *username* is the name you used in step **3** of
         :ref:`Configuring the tutorial asset root and source volume <Configuring_Tutorial_Asset_Root>`.

      #. Log out as root.
      #. Start the system manager by entering:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion start``

      .. _Clean_Up_Tutorial_Workspace:
      .. rubric:: Clean up the tutorial workspace

      When a user completes the tutorial or no longer needs the tutorial
      data, you can clean up that tutorial workspace, if desired, by
      removing the tutorial source files, asset root, and published
      databases. This section describes the best way to perform that
      cleanup.

      .. note::

         Google recommends that you keep the tutorial files intact, since
         they use very little space and can come in handy for users to practice,
         even after they have quite a bit of experience with Google Earth
         Enterprise Fusion.

      .. rubric:: To remove the tutorial source files, asset root, and
         databases:
         :name: to-remove-the-tutorial-source-files-asset-root-and-databases

      #. At the command line prompt, log in as root.
      #. Stop the system manager by entering:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion stop``

      #. Select the production asset root by entering:

         ``geselectassetroot --assetroot /gevol/assets``

         Substitute the appropriate asset root path, if necessary.

      #. Stop the Google Earth Enterprise Server:

         ``/etc/init.d/geserver stop``

      #. Delete the tutorial files:

         ``rm -Rf /opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion/``

      #. Delete the user’s tutorial asset root by entering:

         ``rm -Rf /username/assets``

         where *username* is the name of the user you specified when you
         configured the tutorial workspace.

         .. warning::

            Make sure you are removing the tutorial asset
            root, not the production root. If you delete the production
            root, there is no way to recover it (other than from backups,
            if available).

      #. Start the Google Earth Enterprise Fusion system manager and
         Google Earth Enterprise Server:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion start``
         ``/etc/init.d/geserver start``

         The order in which you start them does not matter.

      #. List the databases on the current server by entering:

         ``geserveradmin --listdbs``

         The tool displays a list of all databases ever published
         (other than deleted databases) on the server. If the server
         type is omitted, the server type defaults to ``stream``.

      #. Select the database you want to remove by entering:

         ``geserveradmin --deletedb db_name...``

         where *db_name* is the name of the database you want to delete.

         .. note::

            If you want to delete a currently published database,
            you can either publish a different database to the same virtual
            server or disable the virtual server on which it is published.
            Then you can delete the database.

            This tool does not delete the actual files. It is similar to
            putting files in the trash on a Windows or Mac desktop.

      #. Permanently delete the selected databases by entering:

         ``geserveradmin --garbagecollect``
