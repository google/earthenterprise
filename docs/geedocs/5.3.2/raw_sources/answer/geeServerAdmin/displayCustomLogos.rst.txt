Display custom logos

      Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) 5.0 and later can display
      multiple custom logos with your globes and maps when connected to
      a GEE Server.

      Custom logos are added as database preferences or *snippets*,
      which are managed using :doc:`snippet
      profiles <>` you create using GEE Server.
      Once you have saved a custom logo in a snippet profile, you can
      assign it to any database you publish. You can apply a snippet
      profile to as many databases as you need.

      .. rubric:: Cobrand_info snippet

      You can use the **cobrand_info** snippet within a snippet profile
      to place your logos anywhere in the Google Earth EC window.

      The benefits of using **cobrand_info** are:

      -  You can access logos at both local and remote addresses (UNC,
         HTTP, and HTTPS). However, we recommend that you host your logos
         on GEE Server to ensure accessiblity to the server and Google
         Earth EC.
      -  PNG, GIF, and JPEG image formats are supported.
      -  Transparent logos are supported.
      -  You can place logos anywhere on the screen.
      -  You can display multiple logos at the same time.
      -  You can use either absolute pixel values or relative screen
         size values to place logos.
      -  Logos can either be a fixed size or scaled to the width of the
         screen.
      -  Logos are included with saved images and printouts from EC.

      .. rubric:: Cobrand_info snippet definition

      You define the **cobrand_info** snippet by specifying the URL from
      which the logo will be served, the screen width size, the tie
      point (which controls the reference point used when overlaying the
      logo), and x and y coordinates, expressed as either absolute values
      in pixels or relative values of percentage of screen width or
      height.

      The following **cobrand_info** example snippet places the
      *top_right.jpg* logo in the upper-right corner of the window (the
      top right of the image is 5 pixels from the right edge of the
      window edge, using an absolute x coordinate value, and 95% from
      the bottom using a relative y coordinate value), and sets it to
      dynamically scale to 5% of the screen width as the Google Earth EC
      window is resized.

      .. rubric:: Cobrand_info parameters

      The following table describes the cobrand_info snippet parameters,
      all of which are required.

      .. rubric:: Add a custom logo

      You can add any number of custom logos to your maps and globes,
      adding each one using a **cobrand_info** snippet. The ideal size
      for your logo is 64 x 64 pixels.

      .. rubric:: To add a custom logo:

      #. Upload your logo file to a web server in the network. To host
         the file on your GEE Server (for example,
         ``http://servername/filename.ext``), copy it to
         ``/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs``.
      #. Access the Google Earth Enterprise Server Admin console in a
         browser window by going to *myserver.mydomainname*.com/admin,
         replacing *myserver* and *mydomainname* with your server and
         domain.
      #. Sign in with the default credentials or the username and
         password assigned to you:

         -  Default username: *geapacheuser*
         -  Default password: *geeadmin*

         **Note:** If you do not know your username and password,
         contact your Google Earth Enterprise Server System
         Administrator.

      #. Click **Snippet profiles** to display your snippet profiles.
      #. Click **Create New**. The **Create new snippet profile** dialog
         appears.

         |GEE Server Create Snippet Profile dialog|

      #. Enter a name for the new snippet profile and click **Create**.
         The snippet profile name appears in red in the **Existing
         snippet profile** list and the **Snippet editor** opens.
      #. Click the **Add a new snippet set to the profile** drop-down to
         display the list of available snippets.
      #. Select the **cobrand_info** snippet from the list.

         |GEE Server Select cobrand_info Snippet|

      #. Enter a URL for the path of the custom logo. Select whether
         your x and y coordinate values are expressed as relative or
         absolute and enter the parameter values. All fields must be
         completed.

         |GEE Server cobrand_info Snippet definition|

      #. Click **Save changes** to save the snippet profile.

      .. rubric:: To apply a custom logo to a globe or map:

      #. In the GEE Server Admin console, click **Databases**. The list
         of databases on GEE server appears.
      #. Check the box next to the database to which you want to apply
         your custom logo. Click **Publish**. The Publish dialog
         appears.
      #. Select your snippet profile for your custom logo from the
         **Snippet profiles** drop-down list.

         |GEE Server Publish dialog snippet profile|

         .. tip::

            If you have already published your database, you need to
            **Unpublish** before publishing again, this time adding your
            snippet profile to apply your custom logo.

      #. Click the **Publish** button to publish your database with the added
         snippet profile.

         Now, when you view your database in Google Earth EC, your custom
      logo is displayed.

      .. tip::

         Google Earth EC recognizes only the snippet profile settings
         made by the first database that you connect to. This applies
         when you are connecting to multiple databases.

      .. rubric:: Single logo at top-left

        This example places one logo in the upper-left corner of the
        window (the top-left of the image is 5% of the window width
        from the left side of the window, and 95% from the bottom), and
        sets it to dynamically scale to 10% of the window width as the
        window is resized.

      .. rubric:: Single logo at mid right

         This example places one logo at the vertical midpoint on the
         right side of the window using absolute and relative coordinate
         values. The center-right logo tiePoint is placed 5 pixels from
         the right window edge and at 50% of the relative window height.
         EC requests the file using HTTPS (as specified in **logo_url**)
         and does not scale the logo.

         |cobrand_info right-center example|

      .. rubric:: Single logo at top-center

         This example places one logo at the top-center of the window.
         The top-center tiePoint of the logo is placed, by relative
         coordinates, at the 50% window width and 98% window height, and
         the logo dynamically scales to 9% of the window width.

         |cobrand_info top-center example|

      .. rubric:: Single logo at lower-right corner

         This example places one logo in the bottom-right corner of the
         window by combining relative and absolute coordinate values.
         The bottom-right logo tiePoint is placed at 80% of the window
         width from the left window edge, leaving a 20% margin at the
         right window edge, and 30 pixels from the bottom window edge.
         The logo is dynamically scaled to occupy 20% of the window
         width.

         |cobrand_info bottom-right example|

      .. rubric:: Single logo at upper-left corner

         This example places one logo in the upper-left corner of the
         window using absolute pixel values. The top-left logo tiePoint
         is placed 5 pixels from the left window edge and 5 pixels from
         the top window edge, and the logo is displayed without scaling.
