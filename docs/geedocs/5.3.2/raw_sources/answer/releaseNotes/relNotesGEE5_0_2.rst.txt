           - When attempting to set the maximum number of CPUs used for
             Fusion processing tasks, **geselectassetroot --numcpus** fails to update the value specified.
           - For GEE releases 5.0.0-5.0.2, the maximum number of CPUs can be set using the
             ``maxjobs`` option in ``/opt/google/etc/systemrc``.

                #. Stop Fusion daemons:
                   ``sudo /etc/init.d /gefusion stop``
                #. Set ``maxjobs`` in ``/opt/google/etc/ systemrc``.
                #. Start Fusion daemons:
                   ``sudo /etc/init.d/gefusion start``

           - When attempting to import the **GDAL** library installed with
             ``/opt/google/gepython/Python-2.7.5/bin/python`` Python 2.7.5, from
             ``osgeo import gdal_array``, a traceback error occurs:
             ``ImportError: No module named _gdal_array``.
           - Fixed. The Python numpy library, which is required to load the ``gdal_array`` module,
             is now bundled with GEE Fusion.
         * - 11823150
           - When setting the maximum number of CPUs available for Fusion processes using the
             ``geselectassetroot --numcpus`` command, you cannot increase the value beyond 8.
           - Fixed. You can now set the maximum number of CPUs using the
             ``geselectassetroot --numcpus`` command to a maximum value of 64. You can
             verify the value you set using ``getop`` The default setting for the maximum value is 8.
             For more information, see
             :doc:`Running Fusion on a machine with multiple CPUs <../fusionAdministration/multipleCPUConfig>`.

           - Potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified.
