<h1><a href="../index.html">Google Earth Enterprise Documentation Home</a> | Release notes</h1>
<h2>Release notes: Open GEE 5.2.1</h2>
<p>Open GEE 5.2.1 is a comprehensive update of <a href="../answer/7160000.html">Open GEE 5.2.0</a>. It contains new features, several bug fixes in Fusion and GEE Server, and updates to third-party libraries.</p>
  <h5>
    <p id="overview_5_2_1">New Features</p>
  </h5> 
    <p><strong>MrSID support</strong>. At build time, Open GEE checks for MrSID libraries and, if found, Fusion will be built with MrSID raster format support.</p>
    <p><strong>RPM Installers</strong>. For RedHat and CentOS, RPMs can now be built to enable easier installation.
	For Ubuntu, the installer scripts continue to be the supported way to install Open GEE.</p>
    <p><strong>JPEG2000 performance boost</strong>. Updated version of OpenJpeg2000 library has considerable performance increase.</p>
    <p><strong>Controlling quality of terrain</strong>. Command-line tool gepackgen producing packets now accepts a decimation value. In general, reducing the decimation value for terrain produces higher quality and better looking terrain.</p>		
    <p><strong>Testing scripts enhanced</strong>. <code>publish_tutorial.sh</code> and <code>publish_historical.sh</code> scripts now publish the pushed databases.</p>
    <p><strong>Detailed version info</strong>. Version number displayed in user interface shows detailed information indicating an official release or a development build.</p>
	<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong>. Travis CI is used for continuous integration. On every new commit to Open GEE a build is executed to validate the committed changes.</p>
  <h5>
    <p id="supported_5.2.1">Supported Platforms</p>
  </h5>
  <p>Open GEE 5.2.1 is supported on 64-bit versions of the following operating systems:</p>

      <li>CentOS 6.x and 7.x</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.1 is compatible with Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.</p>

  <h5>

  <p>To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.2.1. Installing Open GEE 5.2.1 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed-up and upgraded correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.1.</p>
