Add .kip imagery

GEE can use pre-processed imagery in

Keyhole Imagery Product

 (".kip") format. Each ".kip" folder has a corresponding

Keyhole Mask Product

 (".kmp") folder that contains the mask for the imagery. The
corresponding folders have the same name.

To add ".kip" imagery to the asset tree:

Store each .kip/.kmp folder pair in the same directory.

Set read-and-execute permissions for the keyhole:users account.

Use the khnewimageryasset --havemask command to add the files. Specify
the asset name, the provider information (USGS), and the location of
the .kip folder. For example, if city_one.kip and city_one.kmp are in
/gevol/src/preprocessed/noame/usa/, the command is:  genewimageryasset
--havemask --provider (PROVIDER_KEY) -o
path/to/asset/in/tree/gevol/src/preprocessed/noame/usa/city_one.kip

Repeat this step for each .kip/.kmp combination you want to add.

You can access the assets from the Fusion Asset Manager whenever you
want to use them in imagery projects. You are still required to build
each asset in the system, but the build time will be insignificant
because each ".kip/.kmp" combination is preprocessed.
