Configure your data locations

The Google Earth Enterprise installation script prompts you to enter
information about your system and then properly configures your
primary asset root and source volume. After you install Google Earth
Enterprise Fusion, use the "geconfigureassetroot" command to:

Add asset roots.  If you use the About this Tutorial, Google
recommends that you specify separate asset roots for each user’s
tutorial data and a completely different asset root for your real
working data. See Configure Tutorial Workspace to learn how to
configure and select an asset root for the tutorial, as well as how to
clean up tutorial files.

Identify source volumes.  You must identify each directory that
contains your source data files (or subdirectories of your source data
files). Google Earth Enterprise Fusion is not able to read files
located in other directories.

Modify the current volume.  You can modify volume definitions when
migrating from a single- to a multiple-workstation configuration or
when modifying the local path of a network-mounted source volume (for
example, when adding a larger drive for source data).

For more information on these commands, see

geconfigureassetroot

.

Warning: Do not modify the volume definition after you save data to
  that volume. Because the local name and the network path definitions
  are used by Google Earth Enterprise Fusion for resources, projects,
  and database definitions, any change to a volume definition
  invalidates the data already processed on that volume.

If you add multiple asset roots, you can use the "geselectassetroot"
to specify the volume in which you want to work and to switch back and
forth among the available asset roots, if desired. For more
information on these commands, see

geconfigureassetroot

.
