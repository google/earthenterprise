Search your POI vector data or map layer data
=============================================

.. container::

   .. container:: content

      With GEE, you can perform simple text searches of your POI vector
      data or map layer data. If you have one or more text fields that
      you would like to query from vector or map layer data in a
      project, you can simply add those search fields to that vector
      data’s layer. You include the layer as part of the :ref:`vector
      project <Define_Vector_Project>` that you want to include
      in the 2D or 3D database.

      For example, you may be interested in displaying the US Census
      Bureau population statistics on your map or globe, based on county
      name. Once you have added the census data as a layer in a vector
      project, you can easily add the search fields to the individual
      population data layer in the vector project. You can also choose
      how you want the labels for the search results to appear on the
      map, such as search and display a field, or simply display it.

      .. rubric:: Add search fields to individual layers of your vector
         projects

      After you have added a layer to a vector project, you can
      configure it to add search functionality. You use the **Search**
      tab in the Layer Properties dialog to specify one or more search
      fields to query your source data.

      .. rubric:: To add search fields to individual layers of a vector
         project:

      #. In the Asset Manager, double-click the name of the project in
         which you want to modify layers. The Vector Project Editor
         displays the list of layers included in the project.
      #. View the layer properties for a resource in a project by
         right-clicking the layer name in the Vector Project Editor and
         selecting **Layer Properties** from the context menu.
      #. Click the **Search** tab in the Layer Properties dialog.

         |Layer Properties Search Tab|

      #. Click |New Icon|. The Add Search Field dialog appears.

         |Layer Properties Add Search|

      #. Select the desired field from the **Column Name** drop-down
         list. Select an option from the **Use** drop-down list:

         -  **Search Only** - Google Earth EC searches against the
            selected field but does not display the results.
         -  **Display Only** - Google Earth EC displays the values of
            the selected field in the results but does not search
            against the selected field.
         -  **Search and Display** - Google Earth EC searches against
            the selected field and displays the results.

         An example of search fields added to a layer in a vector
         project describes the use of US Census Bureau data and setting
         up fields to query the County name and display the population
         per county in the results shown in the client. See the tutorial
         lesson :doc:`../fusionTutorial/searchFldsForLayers`.

      #. Repeat the steps above for each additional field you want to
         add to the search. Your selections appear on the list of search
         fields on the Search tab in the order in which you added them:

         |Layer Properties Add Search Full|

         The order in which the fields appear on this list is the order
         in which they appear in the description balloon in the client.
         (The fields designated as **Search Only** do not affect the
         order in which the fields to be displayed appear.)

      #. To change the order in which the fields appear, select a field and use the |Layer
         Properties Add Search Up Arrow Icon| and |Layer Properties Add
         Search Down Arrow Icon| arrows.
      #. To remove a field, select it and click |Layer Properties Add Search Delete
         Icon|.
      #. Click the **OK** button to save the Search field properties.
      #. Select **File > Save** in the Vector Project Editor to save the
         changes to the layer.

         .. note::

            This search performs an exact match, which means
            that the Google Earth EC user must enter the value exactly
            as it appears in the database. It can also perform a
            wildcard search, so users can enter part of the text they
            want to match. For example, if a user enters “dakota” in a
            state search, the search results match “North Dakota” and
            “South Dakota”.

      #. Once you have added your POI vector project to the database you
         want to publish, push it to GEE Server, then turn on **POI
         Search** when you publish.

         |Publish Dialog POI Search|

      Setting the **+Enhanced Search** to **On** will first perform
      a **POI search** against the vector data in your database, and if
      no results are found, perform an **Enhanced Search** using the
      **GeocodingFederated** search plug-in, searching your
      database for queried places or coordinates.

      For example, if your query in Google Earth EC for a city name
      returned no results via the POI search plug-in, the GeoFederated
      search plugin would automatically search for that city name.

      .. note::

         The POI Search option in the Publish dialog is only
         available if you build your database with POI data as a vector
         resource layer. If you want to perform a POI search on a
         database external to your globe or map, e.g., on a
         different server, you can use the POI Search tab or create your
         own custom search plug-in.

      Once you have added the search fields, the main Search tab in
      Google Earth EC displays the POI search and includes the field(s)
      that you specified for your queries.

      |Database With Search Tab|

      .. rubric:: Specify POI Search tab settings

      You can also modify the appearance of the POI search tab in Google
      Earth EC by editing the system search tab, **POI Search**, which
      sets the query parameters for the search fields you added to your
      vector layer, as well as specifying the labels for the tab, query
      field, and suggestion box.

      .. rubric:: To specify the settings of the POI Search tab:

      #. In the :doc:`GEE Server Admin console <../geeServerAdmin/signInAdminConsole>`,
         click **Search tabs**.
      #. Check the box next to **POISearch**, then click **Edit**.

         The Edit Search Definition dialog appears.

         |POI Search Tab Definition|

      #. Edit the name of the system search tab to create your own
         POISearch tab definition. You cannot modify system search tabs
         without changing the name.
      #. Edit the label, specify any query parameters and modify the
         field label and suggestion box as required.
      #. Click the **Save** button.
      #. Click **Databases** to swtich to the list of available
         databases on GEE Server. Check the box next to the database you
         want to publish with search, then click **Publish**. The
         Publish dialog appears.
      #. Change the **POI Search** option to **On**.

         Setting the **+Enhanced Search** to **On** also will first
         perform a **POI search** against the vector data in your
         database, and then, if no results are found, perform an **Enhanced Search**
         using the **GeocodingFederated** search plug-in,
         searching your database for queried places or coordinates.

      #. Click the **Search tabs** drop-down list to add your POI search
         tab.

         |POI Search Tab in Publish Dialog|

      #. Click the **Publish** button. A message appears to confirm the successful
         publishing process.
