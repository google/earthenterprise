      .. _Introduction_Portable_Developer:
      .. rubric:: Introduction

      You can customize or extend GEE Portable, or create applications
      that work with it.

      To help you get started, Google provides two ``Hello World!``
      files that you can copy and use as templates. These files
      (``Hello_Maps.html`` for 2D maps and ``Hello_Earth.html`` for 3D
      globes) call the required scripts, load the globe or map, define
      the ``.css`` file, and so on. The files include JSON and, if
      needed, KML polygons.

      See the resources linked to below to learn how to edit and extend
      the ``Hello_Maps.html`` and ``Hello_Earth.html`` files.

      .. _Useful_Resources_Portable_Developer:
      .. rubric:: Useful resources

      .. note::
      
         Clicking any of these links connects you to a site
         outside your network. If you are not sure if your organization
         allows outside connections, check with your administrator first.

      ``Hello_Maps.html`` and ``Hello_Earth.html`` are based on the
      Google Maps API and Google Earth API. More information about these
      APIs is linked to below. Also included are links to some resources
      for learning how to parse your JSON data and KML coordinates.

      -  `Google Maps API help at https://developers.google.com/maps/ <https://developers.google.com/maps/>`_.
         
         Examples that use the Maps API.

      -  `Google Earth API help at https://developers.google.com/earth/ <https://developers.google.com/earth/>`_.
         
         *The Earth Plug-in and its API have been discontinued.*

      -  `jQuery help at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/ <http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/>`_.
         
         A method for parsing JSON.

      -  `geoxml3 at https://code.google.com/p/geoxml3/ <https://code.google.com/p/geoxml3/>`_.
         
         A KML processor for use with the Google Maps API.

      .. _Hello_Maps:
      .. rubric:: Hello Maps!

      To write a script to display portable 2D maps, start with
      ``hello_maps.html`` and edit as needed. ``hello_maps.html`` is
      based on the Google Maps API.

      .. rubric:: To access the ``hello_maps.html`` file:

      #. Launch GEE Portable on ``localhost:9335``.
      #. Enter
         ``http://localhost:9335/local/preview/developers/hello_maps.html``
         in your browser.
      #. View the page source. If you are not sure how to view the page
         source, see your browser's help.

      Alternatively, click the link below:

      :doc:`../portable/helloMapsSample`

      .. _Hello_Earth:
      .. rubric:: Hello Earth!

      To write a script to display portable 3D maps (globes), start with
      ``hello_earth.html`` and edit as needed. *The ``hello_earth.html``
      example is based on the discontinued Google Earth API.* Take that
      into consideration when developing new applications.

      .. rubric:: To access the ``Hello_Earth`` file:

      #. Launch GME Portable on ``localhost:9335``.
      #. Enter
         ``http://localhost:9335/local/preview/developers/hello_earth.html``
         in your browser.
      #. View the page source. If you are not sure how to view the page
         source, see your browser's help.

      .. _JSON_Documents:
      .. rubric:: JSON documents

      Whenever your Portable instance is running, multiple JSON
      documents are serving. The JSON finds information about all your
      available globes and maps, as well as your current globe or map.
      Below are some code snippets that show how the JSON works.

      .. rubric:: Globes JSON example

      This code snippet is from the Globes JSON document, which
      provides information about each available globe.

      .. code-block:: none
      
         Globes JSON: [yourhost]/?cmd=globes_info_json
         
         [ {  "name":"test.glb",
            "timestamp":"2013-01-01 12:00:00",
            "size":"20.00MB",
            "description":"Some globe description.",
            "path":"../../../../globes/test.glb",
            "is_gee":true,
            "is_2d":false,
            "is_3d":true,
            "has_polygon":true,
            "is_mercator":false,
            "is_being_served":false
            },
            {
            some other globe
            },...
         ]

      .. rubric:: 2D JSON and 3D JSON examples

      The 2D and 3D JSON documents contain layer information as well
      as information that helps the Search feature categorize the
      results.

      If you are currently serving a map, 2D JSON will be serving:

      ``2D JSON: [yourhost]/query?request=Json&vars=geeServerDefs&is2d=t``
      If you are currently serving a globe, 3D JSON will be serving:

      ``3D JSON: [yourhost]/query?request=Json&vars=geeServerDefs``

      .. rubric:: Layer Definition examples

      Below are examples of layer definitions. The first is an imagery
      layer and the second is a vector layer.

      .. rubric:: Imagery layer example

      .. code-block:: none
      
         [
         ...{
            icon : "icons/1.png",
            id : 1001,
            initialState : true,
            isPng : false,
            label : "Imagery",
            lookAt : "none",
            opacity : 1,
            requestType : "ImageryMaps", // A layer of imagery. version : 8
            }...
         ]

      .. rubric:: Vector data example

      .. code-block:: none
      
         [
         ...{
            icon : "icons/2.png",
            id : 1002,
            initialState : true,
            isPng : true,
            label : "Tokyo",
            lookAt : "none",
            opacity : 1,
            requestType : "VectorMapsRaster", // Vector data, such as roads, points, and borders. version : 4
         }...
         ]

      .. _Polygon_KML_Document:
      .. rubric:: Polygon KML document

      Some globes also serve a KML file that contains polygon
      coordinates, which define the initial display when the globe or
      map loads. Polygon KML files also let Google Earth and Google Maps
      draw a polygon on the globe or map. If a globe does not have any
      polygon data, the Polygon KML file is empty.

      .. rubric:: Polygon KML example

      This is an example of a KML document that contains a set of
      coordinates that define the bounds of your globe's cut.

      .. code-block:: none
      
         Polygon KML: [your host]/earth/polygon.kml
         
         <?xml version="1.0"
