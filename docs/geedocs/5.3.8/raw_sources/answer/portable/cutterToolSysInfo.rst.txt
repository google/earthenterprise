      When using the Portable Globe Cutter tool:

      -  Building a portable globe is CPU and disk I/O intensive and can
         impact GEE Server operation for the duration of the build.
      -  You can implement user authentication for the GEE Portable
         Globe Cutter web page with standard Apache web server user
         authentication. By default, the Cutter web page is accessible
         to all users who create their own globes.
      -  The portable globe cutting service is disabled after you
         install GEE Server software. You must manually enable the
         Cutter tool:

         -  In GEE 5.0: ``gecutter enable``
         -  In earlier versions: ``geserveradmin --enable_cutter``

      -  The Cutter tool writes temporary files to the
         ``globes/.globe_builder`` folder. These temporary files are
         removed following successful globe cutting operations. However,
         if the globe cutting operations are interrupted, files might be
         left in the ``globes/.globe_builder`` folder. You can manually
         remove the leftover files.
      -  Stopping the GEE Server during a cut might result in cut that
         is not fully formed.
      -  Globe cutting operations can sometimes be interrupted,
         resulting in "runaway" globe cutting processes that an
         administrator must manually halt at the operating system level.
         See :doc:`../portable/manuallyHaltCutter`.
      -  The Cutter web tool is incompatible with load-balanced
         configurations, and should only be operated on a machine that
         end users can access directly. This can be a production machine
         with GEE Server software that is hosting a 3D globe, or a
         development machine that has GEE Server software installed. You
         can serve portable globes (.glb files) that have already been
         created from load-balanced GEE Servers or any web server.
