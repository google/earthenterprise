Back up Fusion servers
======================

.. container::

   .. container:: content

      The Fusion server typically stores multiple terabytes of source
      data and intermediate assets. If you have a tape backup system or
      enough disk space, you should perform a full back up of the server
      any time a new database is built or a significant amount of new
      data is processed. If you do not have enough resources to do this,
      you can back up only critical files and display rules
      instead.

      .. rubric:: Display rules

      Typically, you will spend quite a bit of time defining display
      rules exactly the way you want them, so you should back them up each time you modify a vector layer.

      To back up display rules:

      #. In the Vector Layer dialog box, select **Export as a
         Template**.
      #. Save the display rules on a volume different from the source
         volume and the asset root.

      .. rubric:: Critical Fusion files
         :name: critical-fusion-files

      If you have backups of the files listed below, you can rebuild
      your database with some patience and scripting. The rebuild will
      take a lot of CPU time, but should go smoothly with a minimum of
      administrator time.

      The files that are critical to restoring your Fusion server are:

      -  **Your original source files**. These are typically stored on a
         network shared drive or on portable USB disks, depending on the
         environment. Make sure that you can find and reload your
         original source files.
      -  **The XML files that Fusion generates during its processing**.
         These are critical because they contain the display rules for
         the vector data, the rules for building resources and projects,
         and other critical settings.
      -  **All the files under /opt/google/gehttpd in the cgi-bin, conf
         conf.d, and htdocs directory**. These files contain any
         user-customized scripts or web pages, and the definitions of
         any virtual servers you created on the Fusion server.
      -  **The files in the .config and .userdata directories under the
         asset root**. These contain custom icons and provider
         information as well as some basic Fusion configuration
         settings.

      .. rubric:: Backing up

      The steps below show you how to back up your critical files. When
      you run these commands, replace the asset root and backup
      locations with the locations of your own asset root and backups.

      #. Make sure that you can locate and reload all the source data
         files if needed.
      #. Create a directory to hold the backup files:

         .. code-block:: bash

            mkdir -p /data/backup/assets
            mkdir -p /data/backup/gehttpd

      #. Back up the gehttpd files:

         .. code-block:: bash

            cd /opt/google/gehttpd
            rsync -r htdocs cgi-bin conf conf.d /data/backup/gehttpd

      #. Back up the XML files and config files to a safe place on a
         disk that is not part of the asset root or source directories:

         .. code-block:: bash

            cd /gevol/assets
            rsync -r .config .userdata /data/backup/assets/
            find . -name "*.xml" > FileList.txt
            rsync --files-from=FileList.txt /gevol/assets /data/backup/assets/

      #. (Optional.) Store a compressed backup of the files somewhere
         else:

         .. code-block:: bash

            tar czf /home/backups/GevolXmlBackup.tgz /data/backups

      .. rubric:: Restoring imagery and terrain

      #. Make sure that the Fusion software is installed correctly and
         is running.
      #. Configure your asset root to be consistent with your old asset
         root. If you are not sure about this, manually run commands
         like:

         .. code-block:: bash

            geconfigureassetroot --new --chown --assetroot /gevol/assets
            geselectassetroot --assetroot /gevol/assets

      #. Restore the backed-up XML and configuration files to their
         original location in the asset root.
      #. Restore the source files to their original location on the
         Fusion server. If you cannot remember the directory they were
         in, just place them on the Fusion server in the source
         directory you specified in the Fusion volume definitions
         (``/gevol/src`` by default).
      #. Use the ``gequery`` command and shell scripting to make sure
         your source files are in the right place. If the files are not
         found, find them and copy them to the right place. Below is an
         example of a script for reporting where all your imagery source
         files should be located. You can use the same script for
         terrain resources if you change ``kiasset`` to ``ktasset``.
         Example script:

         .. code-block:: bash

            cd /gevol/assets
            for resource in `find . -type d -name "*.kiasset"`
            do
               for file in `gequery --infiles $resource`
               do
                  if [ ! -f $file ] && [ ! -d $file ]
                  then
                        echo "Can not find $file"
                  else
                        echo "Found $file"
                  fi
               done
            done

      #. After all the files are in place, generate a series of commands
         to rebuild the resources. For example:

         .. code-block:: bash

            cd /gevol/assets
            for resource in `find . -type d -name "*.kiasset" | sed 's/.kiasset//'`
            do
                gequery --infiles $resource > filelist
                genewimageryresource -o $resource --filelist filelist
                sleep 1
                gebuild $resource
            done

      #. There is a ``khasset.xml`` file under each ``.kiasset``
         directory that contains information about the mask tolerance,
         feathering, white fill, and provider for each imagery and
         terrain resource. You can use scripting to extract this
         information from each resource and add it to the
         ``genewimageryresource`` command to apply the correct settings
         for each resource.

      .. rubric:: Restoring vectors

      The vector restore process is different from the imagery and
      terrain process because of the display rules that each vector
      layer has. These display rules take a very long time to configure,
      and typically the Fusion administrator has not saved the display
      rules as a template. Without the XML files, the vector project can
      take many hours to recreate. Fortunately, all the display rules
      for each vector layer are contained in a single file called
      ``khasset.xml``. This file is under the vector project's main
      directory, and is included in the backup script listed above. The
      ``restore_vector_project.pl`` file below reads the khasset.xml
      file, and creates the commands and display templates necessary to
      rebuild the entire vector project.

      .. rubric:: restore_vector_project.pl
         :name: restore_vector_project.pl
