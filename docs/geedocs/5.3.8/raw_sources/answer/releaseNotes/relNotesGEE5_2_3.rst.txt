      .. rubric:: New Features

      **C++11 support**. With release 5.2.3 Open GEE C++ code now
      supports and defaults to compiling using the ``-std=gnu++11``
      compile flag. This default can be overridden and the C++ code can
      be compiled using the ``-std=gnu++98`` flag instead. However, Open
      GEE 5.2.3 will be the last release to support compiling C++ code
      using the ``-std=gnu++98`` flag. The subsequent releases after
      Open GEE 5.2.3 will no longer support the ``-std=gnu++98`` flag.
      All C++ code will need to conform to the gnu++11 standard.

      **Remove TCP/IP connections to PostgreSQL**. With release 5.2.3
      Open GEE code will now, by default, connect to PostgreSQL
      exclusively using Unix domain sockets. This will make it easier to
      secure PostgreSQL for security sensitive installations. For those
      upgrading from a previous release the following files will need to
      be changed before disabling PostgreSQL tcp listener:

      -  /opt/google/search/conf/ExampleSearch.conf
      -  /opt/google/search/conf/GEPlacesSearch.conf
      -  /opt/google/search/conf/PoiSearch.conf

      You will need to change the host from '127.0.0.1' to '/tmp'
      **Volume deletion**. ``geconfigureassetroot`` now supports the
      option ``--removevolume`` for volume deletion.

      **Performance tuning for gecombineterrain**. ``gecombineterrain``
      now supports the option ``--numCompressThreads`` which specifies
      the number of maximum worker threads used to compress packets in
      this operation. If not specified ``gecombineterrain`` defaults
      this option to match the number of available CPUs.

      **Package name customization at build time**. Scons build now
      accepts a custom label argument which is appended to the version
      in RPM file names.

      **Rewrite KML URLs**. Users can rewrite the URLs for KML resources
      included in databases at publish time.

      **Maps API JavaScript Files**. Maps API Javascript files are now
      available and installed at
      ``/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps/mapfiles``.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.2.3 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.3 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.

      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.2.3. Installing Open GEE 5.2.3 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.3.

           - Resolution
         * - 225
           - Fusion lets you create folder with space in the name
           - AssetManager UI only allows letters, numbers, and underscores for directory name creation
         * - 226
           - Verify the wrongly spelled "aquisition" is not appearing anywhere in the product
           - Fixed these spelling errors by replacing with Acquisition in multiple files.
         * - 337
           - Add a compiler version check to scons scripts
           - Scons scripts ensure gcc version 4.8+ is installed before continuing with builds
         * - 342
           - Fusion UI crashes when opening non supported type of file
           - Added check to kiasset, ktasset, xml file load to handle invalid files
         * - 535
           - DownloadTutorial.sh often is not staged properly for install
           - Tutorial download script is now included in the Fusion RPM
         * - 682
           - Update geconfigurepublishroot to fully correct file permissions
           - geconfigurepublishroot recursively sets the owner and permissions for publish root
         * - 731
           - Error in publish of SSL-enabled database
           - Temporary fix from 5.2.2 was found to be the best solution
         * - 762
           - Package libraries and utilities common to Fusion and Server for Ubuntu 16
           - opengee-common deb packages can be created for Ubuntu 16
         * - 806
           - gecombineterrain defaulted to only 1 cpu to process data and ignored arguments
           - Added --numCompressThreads option to accept the number of threads to use.
             Default value is the number of CPUs available. Deprecated --numcpus option
         * - 821
           - Calling geeInitMap results in an infinite recursive loop
           - Code to display non-existent polygon removed
         * - 835
           - GE Server gets its URL from the client instead of itself
           - Fixed code so that when you publish DB, GEServer's URL will be used and not the
             URL which we get from the Publish request message.
         * - 861
           - Running diagnostics on a server only installation will result in a failure for testAdqeuateDiskSpace
           - This test is skipped if Fusion is not present.
         * - 877
           - Fusion RPM install scripts to only ``chown`` the asset root when necessary
           - Recursively ``chown`` only when the asset root directory has incorrect ownership on a
             Fusion master host. This allows upgrading Fusion on machines where changing asset root
             ownership recursively would be very expensive.
         * - 912
           - TestDiskSpace diagnostics test fails on CentOS7
           - Changed a function to return the percentage of available disk space instead of the percentage of used disk space.
