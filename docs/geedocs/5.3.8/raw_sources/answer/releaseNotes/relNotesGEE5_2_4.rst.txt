      .. rubric:: New Features

      **C++98 no longer supported**. As of 5.2.4 C++11 syntax can be
      used and building open GEE using C++98 standard will no longer be
      supported

      **Added "Save and Build" file menu option**. As of 5.2.4 the
      Fusion UI will include an additional file menu option that allows
      users to save and build assets with one click, instead of clicking
      the save option and then the build option immediately after.

      **Added build parameter to redirect the build output**. Build
      output can now be optionally directed to a folder of your choosing
      instead of the current hard coded defaults. See
      earth_enterprise/BUILD.md in source code for more details.

      **Added experimental build cache folder parameter to the build**.
      Currently this was added as an experimental option to potentially
      speed up builds. Some more work remains to be done before using
      this option in production builds. Use of this option is not
      recommended except for giving feedback and/or helping to address
      issues with Open GEE's build process using scons cache. See
      earth_enterprise/BUILD.md in source code for more details.

      **Added progress indicators during gesystemmanager processing** .
      Add progress log messages to ``gesystemmanager`` while assets are
      being built.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.2.4 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.4 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.

      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.2.4. Installing Open GEE 5.2.4 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.4.
