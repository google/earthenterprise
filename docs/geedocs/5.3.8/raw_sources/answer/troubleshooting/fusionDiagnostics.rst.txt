      The ``geecheck`` script provides information about Fusion server
      versioning, configuration, and current system state.

      To run ``geecheck`` on your Fusion server:

      #. Go to ``/opt/google/share/support/geecheck`` on your Fusion system.

      #. Run the script ``geecheck.pl``.

         .. note::
            You might be prompted to enter a username and
            password. If you are not using authentication for the Fusion
            server, you can ignore the prompts.

      #. Examine the output for potential errors and problems. If you
         need additional help, you can create a new issue on `the GitHub
         repo <https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/issues>`_ that
         includes the output of ``geecheck.pl``.
