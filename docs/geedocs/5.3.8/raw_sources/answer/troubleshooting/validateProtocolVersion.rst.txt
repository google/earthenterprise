      ``Unrecognized notify command: ValidateProtocolVersion``
      
      .. rubric:: Description

      During the initial transition from tools that do not check for
      matching versions to the versions that do check (for example, from
      2.4.x to 3.x), you tried to use a later version of the Fusion GUI
      or command line with a previous version of the system manager.

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      Ensure that you are using the same version of Fusion and GEE
      Server.
