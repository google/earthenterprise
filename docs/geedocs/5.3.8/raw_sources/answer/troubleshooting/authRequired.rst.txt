      .. rubric:: Description

      When you try to publish a database on a server that requires
      authentication, you entered an invalid user name or password three
      times.

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      Be sure that your keyboard does not have **CapsLock** on. Check
      with your system administrator to make sure you have permission to
      publish a database and that you have a valid user name and
      password.
