      ``Unable to decompress pyramid data Fusion Fatal: PrepLoop: Unable to read tile (lrc)``
      
      .. rubric:: Description

      This error occurs when you try to build an imagery project with a
      corrupt imagery resouce.

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      -  If the imagery project must be finished as soon as possible and
         the failed imagery resource can be omitted:

         Drop the failed imagery resource from the project. A new
         version of the imagery project will be built that does not
         include the corrupt imagery resource.

      -  If the imagery project must be finished as soon as possible,
         the failed imagery resource must be included, and the source is
         based on prebuilt imagery ``.kip/.kmp`` folders from another
         machine:

         Verify that all ``.pyr`` files in both the ``.kip`` and
         ``.kmp`` folders are their true size between both systems, then
         replace any ``.pyr`` files that have differences between file
         sizes or checksums. To check for differences, calculate md5
         checksums for each pyramid file in the source folders and the
         target folders. You can restart the failed imagery project
         blend, or blends, afterward.

      -  If the imagery project does not have an immediate deadline, the
         failed imagery resource must be included, and the imagery
         resource was imported from raw source files (such as JPEG2000
         or GeoTIFF) that have good integrity and are not corrupt:

         Re-import the source imagery as a new version of the imagery
         resource. Build a new version of the imagery project to blend
         the new version of the imagery resource.
