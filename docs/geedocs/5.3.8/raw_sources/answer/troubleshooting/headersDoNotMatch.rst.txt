      ``Headers do not match``
      
      .. rubric:: Description

      The error appears in the vector Asset log when there is more than
      one source file in the resource and their attributes are not
      exactly identical. Either the labels are not the same, or one data
      file has an attribute that the other is missing.

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      Make the attribute labels match or, if one data set is lacking an
      attribute, give it an empty column with the same attribute label.
