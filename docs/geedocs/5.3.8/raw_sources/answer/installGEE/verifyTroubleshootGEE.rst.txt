      .. _Verifying_System_Manager_Running:
      .. rubric:: Verifying That the System Manager Is Running

      Because a properly running system manager is critical to using
      Google Earth Enterprise Fusion, as well as for converting your
      source data to Google Earth Enterprise Fusion assets, verify that
      the system manager is running after the initial installation of
      Google Earth Enterprise Fusion and whenever you encounter problems
      building assets.

      To verify that the system manager is running, enter the following
      command at a shell prompt:

      ``getop``

      A list of running processes appears. Two processes appear on the
      list:

      -  ``gesystemmanager``

         This process is necessary to configure or build resources,
         projects, and databases with Google Earth Enterprise Fusion. If
         this process appears on the list, Google Earth Enterprise
         Fusion is running properly.

         If you do not see this process on the list, follow the
         troubleshooting suggestions in the
         :ref:`Troubleshooting <Troubleshooting_Failed_System_Manager>` section to
         correct it.

      -  ``geresourceprovider``

         This process manages the workstation resources on the behalf of
         the system manager. It also monitors free disk space on the
         volumes for any connected workstations.

         If you see a ``connection refused`` message, see the
         :ref:`Troubleshooting <Troubleshooting_Failed_System_Manager>` section.


      .. _Troubleshooting_Failed_System_Manager:
      .. rubric:: Troubleshooting a Failed System Manager

      If the Google Earth Enterprise Fusion system manager fails to run,
      you can try stopping and restarting the it, which resolves most
      minor problems.

      .. _Restarting_System_Manager:
      .. rubric:: Restarting the system manager

      #. Log in as root.
      #. Stop the system manager:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion stop``

      #. Start the system manager:

         ``/etc/init.d/gefusion start``

      If you are still having problems starting the system manager after
      stopping and restarting the system manager, you can view the log
      file for the system manager to see what errors have been reported.
      The log file is located in:

      ``/var/opt/google/log/gesystemmanager.log``

      Any errors are listed after the **Started** notice, which appears
      in the log for each time you started the system manager.

      .. note::

         If you see a ``Connection Refused`` message when
         running the ``getop`` command, but do not see any error
         messages in the log file, ensure that the log directory is
         writable by Google Earth Enterprise Fusion users.

      Likewise, if Google Earth Enterprise Server fails to run, you can
      try stopping and restarting it, which resolves most problems.


      .. rubric:: Restarting the Server

      #. Log in as root.
      #. Stop and restart the server.
      
         ``/etc/init.d/geserver restart``
