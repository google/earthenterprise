<h2>Release notes: Open GEE 5.2.4</h2>

  <h5>
    <p id="overview_5.2.4">New Features</p>
  </h5>
    <p><strong>C++98 no longer supported</strong>. As of 5.2.4 C++11 syntax can be used and building open GEE using C++98 standard will no longer be supported</p>
    <p><strong>Added "Save and Build" file menu option</strong>. As of 5.2.4 the Fusion UI will include an additional file menu option that allows users to save and build assets with one click, instead of clicking the save option and then the build option immediately after.</p>
    <p><strong>Added build parameter to redirect the build output</strong>. Build output can now be optionally directed to a folder of your choosing instead of the current hard coded defaults. See earth_enterprise/BUILD.md in source code for more details.</p>
    <p><strong>Added experimental build cache folder parameter to the build</strong>. Currently this was added as an experimental option to potentially speed up builds. Some more work remains to be done before using this option in production builds. Use of this option is not recommended except for giving feedback and/or helping to address issues with Open GEE's build process using scons cache. See earth_enterprise/BUILD.md in source code for more details.</p>
    <p><strong>Added progress indicators during gesystemmanager processing </strong>. Add progress log messages to <code>gesystemmanager</code> while assets are being built.
  <h5>
    <p id="supported_5.2.4">Supported Platforms</p>
  </h5>
  <p>The Open GEE 5.2.4 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the following operating systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the most recent security patches</li>
      <li>CentOS 6.x and 7.x</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.4 is compatible with Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.</p>
    <p><p>To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.2.4. Installing Open GEE 5.2.4 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.4.</p></p>

              assemble GLMs with differing projections, a warning will be issued.
