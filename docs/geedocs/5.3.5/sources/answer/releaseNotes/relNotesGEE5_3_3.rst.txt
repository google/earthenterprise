Release notes: Open GEE 5.3.3

-[ New Features ]-

Ability to set default database from admin page

. For 3D databases, there is an additional option in the publish
dialog that allows the user to specify a database as the "default".
The "default" database will be served to the client if the server URL
is specified without a database name.

getop can retrieve and display information while gesystemmanager is
busy

. Previously, "getop" could not display information while system
manager was in the middle of major calculations. Now, this restriction
has been removed for most calculations, such as when system manager is
determining which resources overlap.

Improved memory usage reporting for caches

. The memory usage estimation for the asset and asset version caches
has been improved and is much more accurate.

Optimized handling for task status updates

. System manager's performance while handling updates about running
tasks has been improved. This update is experimental and can be
enabled using the

GraphOperations flag

.

Use Python 2.7 with EL6-based operating systems

. Change EL6 to use Python 2.7 from the SCL repositories in a virtual
environment for increased security. EL7 and Ubuntu are unaffected.

Additional refactoring of auto-generated code

. Move ReuseOrMakeAndUpdate and ReuseOrMakeAndUpdateSubAsset from
auto-generated code to the storage manager.

Miscellaneous security updates

. Security updates to prevent SQL injection attacks, buffer overflow
attacks, and other potential risks.

Clarified and updated documentation

. Update documentation. Updates were made for LDAP, for updated
XMLparams changes, in the autogenerated code, and general
clarifications made to existing documentation. Instructions also added
for building on FIPS-enabled machines.

Improved ease of use of Portable for WMS clients

. Accept col/row/level if x/y/z is missing in WMS request when serving
portable globes.
