      Number  Description  Workaround  31619151  Missing historical
imagery dates in EC timeslider  Ensure all assets in the project have
valid timestamps and they are unique (in case some of the resources
have the same date & time).  35093485  Google basemap fails to load in
2D Mercator databases built with "Use Google Basemap" option  Edit
/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps/maps_google.html to include a valid
API Key (or client id) to the Maps API JavaScript call. See
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-
messages#no-api-keys

-[ Resolved Issues ]-

      Number  Description  Resolution  1644180  Improve granularity of
image acquisition date  Fixed in Fusion: imagery acquisition date now
supports hours, minutes and seconds with the (ISO-8601) format YYYY-
MM-DD hh:mm:ss. This new extended timestamp is backward compatible and
enabled in the Fusion UI as well as i command-line tools. Client
support is being added to EC's timeslider; updated version coming
soon.  11271105  gekmlgrabber fails to grab KML files referenced with
relative URLs  Fixed in Cutter.  17300345, 18021264  Missing
cache_alpha files reported when building projects with pre-processed
source data (KIP)  Fixed in Fusion: after upgrading, clean the latest
blocked version of the database, clean the latest blocked version of
the imagery/terrain project, and then rebuild.  21760202
gesystemmanager consumes large amount of of resources (cpu & memory)
when cancelling large projects  Fixed in Fusion: optimized cache when
building raster projects.  24375793  Use asynchronous communication
with server in Portable Viewer  Fixed in Portable Server.  24469566
Search bar disappears after clicking 'go to polygon' in Portable
Viewer  Fixed in Portable Server.  25954774  Implement swap and
replace functions when publishing databases  Fixed in GEE Server: to
facilitate updates to existing published databases, geserveradmin
supports --republish of databases which involves unpublishing an
existing target, and publishing a new database on that same target
while retaining its publish context i.e. virtual host, snippets,
search services, WMS-serving. The --swaptargets option swaps the
target path of two published databases along with their publish
context. This makes it easy to test or revert databases in production
environments. For more information, see geserveradmin usage.
26964919, 27346002  POI searches fail when servers deployed behind
load-balancer  Fixed in GEE Server: deprecate database ID (db_id), and
modify POI search service to query poi_id based on target_path
instead.  27689103  Large POI files break database push  Fixed in
Fusion: Split POI files in 1 GB parts.  28941507  Coordinate search
doesn't send search status to Federated search  Fixed in GEE Server.
30189080  Security: High risk HTTPoxy vulnerability  Fixed in GEE
Server: block HTTP Proxy headers in Apache environment.  30512788
Publish fails when only supplementary search tabs are enabled  Fixed
in GEE Server.  30974078  Portable throws error with blank lines in
portable.cfg  Fixed in Portable Server.  31713095  Check for duplicate
images in Asset Manager  Fixed in Fusion: Imagery Resource file dialog
checks for duplicates such that the same image cannot be added more
than once.  32120563  Get postgreSQL port number from configuration
file  Fixed in GEE Server: custom port numbers for GEE's postgres
service should be specified in the files:
/var/opt/google/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf and /opt/google/gehttpd
/wsgi-bin/conf/postgres.properties. (The default port is 5432.)
32547956  Cutter fails if 'rsync' not present on system  Fixed in GEE
Server: gecutter is no longer dependent on 'rsync' utility.
