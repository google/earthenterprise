Upgrade to GEE 5.x

You can upgrade to Google Earth Enterprise 5.x from versions 4.0.0
through 4.4.1.

-[ Before you upgrade ]-

-[ We recommend you do the following before upgrading to GEE 5.x: ]-

Confirm your hardware and software meet the minimum requirements.

Apply the latest Linux distribution software patches.

Create backups of data stored in the /opt/google/gehttpd/ folders,
including display rule templates, snippet profiles, icons, virtual 2D
and 3D hosts, custom KML data (including SuperOverlays), custom web
pages, CGI scripts, web applications, and JavaScript or HTML files.
During the uninstallation/installation, contents of
/opt/google/gehttpd and other key folders are automatically backed up
to: /var/opt/google/fusion-backups These backups are stored in a
DATE.TIME named folder, for example, 20140310.160027/.

Remove symbolic links from /opt/google/gehttpd/ to other directories.

Create backup copies of any customized Apache Server configuration
files, SSL/HTTPS certificates, user access lists, symbolic links to
other file system directories, and files served from the Apache
document root /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs.

Move or copy portable globe files (.glb or .glm) from the default
globes folder: /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes.

Run garbage collect for stream/search on the GEE server machine. This
will clean all previously deleted databases in /gevol/published_dbs;
/opt/google/bin/geserveradmin --garbagecollect --server_type stream
/opt/google/bin/geserveradmin --garbagecollect --server_type search

Note: GEE 5.x does not support 2D maps in the flat (Plate Carrée)
  projection. If you have previously built and published a map with a
  flat projection, these databases will be marked as invalid, and you
  will not be able to perform any delete, build, push, or publish
  actions on them.

-[ Upgrading ]-

-[ To upgrade to GEE 5.x: ]-

Stop gefusion and geserver.

If you are upgrading from GEE 4.x to 5.x, uninstall previous versions
of Google Earth Enterprise Fusion and Server.  When you uninstall
Google Earth Enterprise Fusion and Server, your asset root remains
unchanged; none of your resources or assets are removed.

Install GEE Fusion and Server 5.x.

For GEE Server, run the following command: sudo -u gepguser
/opt/google/bin/geresetpgdb  geresetpgd deletes registering
information about Fusion databases on GEE Server. After installing GEE
Server/Fusion you will need to:  Rebuild 3D database assets; if Push
is not available, then the database assets need to be rebuilt.  Push
all 3D and 2D Mercator databases. 2D Plate Carrée databases are not
valid in GEE 5.0. See Web Map Service (WMS) for projection support for
Plate Carrée maps.

Upgrade asset root:  sudo /opt/google/bin/geupgradeassetroot
--assetroot /gevol/assets

Optionally enable cutter:  /opt/google/bin/gecutter enable

Start gefusion and geserver.

-[ Issues on upgrading ]-

If you have previously published databases that use ExampleSearch and
are upgrading to 5.3.5, you must install opengee-extra. Otherwise,
ExampleSearch will stop working.

If you are upgrading from 5.3.4.1 or before to 5.3.5 and do not
install opengee-extra, ExampleSearch will still show up in the search
tabs page of the admin console but it will not work (due to a bug).
This is fixed in 5.3.5.1 and beyond.

None of this applies if you use the shell scripts to upgrade rather
than RPMs.

-[ After you upgrade ]-

-[ After upgrading: ]-

Restore backups of data stored in the /opt/google/gehttpd/ folders,
either from your own backup copies or from the backup folder
automatically created during uninstallation/installation:
/var/opt/google/fusion-backups.  Only restore data that you have
customized, including display rule templates, snippet profiles, icons,
virtual 2D and 3D hosts, custom KML data (including SuperOverlays),
custom web pages, CGI scripts, web applications, JavaScript or HTML
files, Apache Server configuration files, SSL/HTTPS certificates, user
access lists, symbolic links to other file system directories, and
files served from the Apache document root /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs.

Rebuild your 3D Fusion database assets (a minimal rebuild will be
forced for terrain and imagery projects). For 2D Mercator databases,
rebuilding is not required.  Push is not available if rebuild is
required. You will need to push each database (3D and 2D Mercator
databases) to GEE Server (database will be registered on server, and
updated files will be pushed), where they can then be published from
the GEE Server Admin console. GEE Server supports serving imagery
packets of old 2D Mercator and 3D Fusion databases.

-[ Compatibility with Google Earth EC ]-

GEE 5.x is compatible with Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and
Plugin versions 7.0.1 - 7.3.x for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
