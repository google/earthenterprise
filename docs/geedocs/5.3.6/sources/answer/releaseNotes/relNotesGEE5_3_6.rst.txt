Release notes: Open GEE 5.3.6

-[ New Features ]-

In 5.3.6, a "--secure" option was added for "geconfigureassetroot" and
"geupgradeassetroot" that removes world-writable permissions from
special files. This helps Open GEE perform properly in strict security
environments. "--secure" is disabled by default.

-[ Supported Platforms ]-

The Open GEE 5.3.6 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
following operating systems:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the most
recent security patches

CentOS 6.x and 7.x

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Google Earth Enterprise 5.3.6 is compatible with Google Earth
Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.

To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend that
you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.3.6.
Installing Open GEE 5.3.6 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that
your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded correctly to the
new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.6.
