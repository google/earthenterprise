Creating a File Accessor Plugin

-[ Experimental ]-

Please note that this functionality is currently experimental.
Creating and using a plugin is not guaranteed to work as expected at
this time.

-[ Description ]-

GEE Server implements a plugin system for file accessors. That is,
plugins can be implemented that provide the ability to read from
different types of file systems, either local or remote. The default
POSIX accessor is built in, but additional plugins can be loaded at
runtime.

-[ How to Implement a Plugin ]-

A file accessor plugin needs 3 components. The first is a function
called "get_factory_v1" that returns a "FileAccessorFactory" pointer.
The signature should be as follows:

   FileAccessorFactory* get_factory_v1 ();

The second component is a factory class that inherits from
"FileAccessorFactory" and overrides the following method:

   virtual AbstractFileAccessor* GetAccessor(const std::string &fileName);

The final component is a class that derives from
"AbstractFileAccessor" and overrides all of the pure virtual methods.
See FileAccessor.h for the complete interface.

-[ Example ]-

To see a barebones sample implementation, look at "earthenterprise/ea
rth_enterprise/src/common/test_plugins/FileAccessorTestPlugin.cpp".

-[ Additional Information ]-

get_factory_v1 should be exported as extern "C" to avoid C++ name
mangling.

Plugins need to be built with the same version of the C++ compiler
that is used to build Open GEE to ensure compatibility.

Plugins should be built as shared libraries (.so)

Once built, plugins can be placed in /opt/google/plugin/fileaccessor/
prior to running GEE Server. If a plugin fails to load, see the error
log for more information.
