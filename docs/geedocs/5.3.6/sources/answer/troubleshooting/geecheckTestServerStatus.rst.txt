Geecheck: test your GEE Server status

Geecheck

 is a tool that checks the health and status of a GEE Server
installation. With GEE 5.1.x, you can use geecheck to run tests and
then view the results in a browser-based dashboard. Results are
organized into

suites

 of results so that you can quickly review the status of Fusion, GEE
Server, as well as see the output of other tests that you write.

Tip: You can also run geecheck from the command line. In GEE 4.4 and
  earlier versions, geecheck runs from the command line only.

-[ How geecheck works ]-

Geecheck is a Python application, "geecheck.py", and is installed in
the following location:

   /opt/google/gehttpd/cgi-bin
      geecheck.py
      geecheck_tests/
         user_tests/
         fusion_tests/
         server_tests/
      run_geecheck.py
      set_geecheck_config.py

geecheck.py runs and displays the results from any tests located in
the subfolders:  geecheck_tests/    user_tests/    fusion_tests/
server_tests/

Tests must follow the naming convention *_test.py, for example,
dns_test.py. Test results are organized by the subfolder or suite they
belong to, i.e., all tests in user_tests are categorized under that
results heading.

-[ Access test results from GEE Server Admin console ]-

-[ To access geecheck from GEE Server Admin console: ]-

Go to myserver.mydomainname.com/admin, replacing myserver and
mydomainname with your server and domain.

Sign in with the default credentials:  Username: geapacheuser
Password: geeadmin  To reset the username and password:  sudo
/opt/google/gehttpd/bin/htpasswd -c
/opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d/.htpasswd geapacheuser

Click the gear icon Settings icon and select Diagnostics from the menu
to display the Geecheck page.

View the Test Summary and Test Details sections to verify the results
of the tests that geecheck ran.

-[ Run the tests again ]-

If you find you need to perform some troubleshooting based on the
results of any of your tests and you need to run the tests again to
confirm whether you have fixed the issue, simply restart GEE Server,
then open the Geecheck page again.

On the command line:  $ sudo /etc/init.d/geserver restart

Access test results from GEE Server Admin console.

-[ Create your own tests ]-

GEE 5.1 includes some basic tests that you can run but "geecheck" is a
framework that lets you easily plug in your own tests and view the
results in a browser or on the command line. Tests should be Python
unit tests and must be copied to one of the three test subfolders to
be run from geecheck:

   geecheck_tests/
      user_tests/
      fusion_tests/
      server_tests/

To get some idea of how you can write your own test, you can study the
structure of the existing tests in the "user_tests" subfolder. Use the
code as a guide or simply copy and edit an existing test if you are
unfamiliar with Python unit tests.

-[ Run geecheck on the command line ]-

You can run "geecheck.py" from the command line with options to
exclude tests and specify the output. The default settings includes
all tests and output text.

-[ Exclude tests: ]-

--no_user_tests

--no_fusion_tests

--no_server_tests

-[ Specify format: ]-

json

text

For example, to output results in JSON format, excluding
"/user_tests":

"$ /opt/google/gehttpd/cgi-bin  python geecheck.py --no_user_tests
json"

-[ Run geecheck in a browser ]-

To provide browser-based output, geecheck uses a wrapper:
"/opt/google/gehttpd/cgi-bin/run_geecheck.py", which runs the
"geecheck.py" script and makes the output available to browsers here:
"http://MY_SERVER/cgi-bin/run_geecheck.py".

The JSON response is used with the following page to make those
results readable: "http://MY_SERVER/admin/geecheck.html", which is the
page that displays when you click the

Settings

 menu icon and select

Diagnostics

 in the GEE Server Admin console.

-[ About moving tests ]-

You may want to run geecheck from a different location, e.g., if you
have already created a large number of tests in a different directory.
Geecheck can be run successfully from a different location with a few
simple rules:

You can move geecheck_tests but you need to maintain the subfolder
structure for geecheck to run:  geecheck_tests/    user_tests/
fusion_tests/    server_tests/

geecheck.py and set_geecheck_config.py must be moved with
geecheck_tests/:  geecheck.py set_geecheck_config.py geecheck_tests/

run_geecheck.py looks for test scripts to run. It should not be moved.
Once test scripts have been moved, set_geecheck_config.py should be
run:

"$ ./set_geecheck_config.py"

This action updates the configuration found at
"/opt/google/geecheck/conf", which tells "run_geecheck.py" where to
look for tests.
