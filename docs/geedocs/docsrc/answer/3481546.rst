      .. rubric:: Backing up your data

      Generally, the most important Google Earth Enterprise Server data is
      all within the ``/var`` directory. If you perform regular backups
      of ``/var``, that covers most of the server data. Google
      recommends that you also back up the following directories:

      ::

         /etc
         /opt/google/gehttpd/conf
         /opt/google/gehttpd/conf.d
         /opt/google/getomcat/conf
         /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs

      With regard to Google Earth Enterprise Fusion data, Google
      strongly recommends that you back up all of your original source
      data (vector and raster). In addition, Google encourages you to
      back up all of the ``.xml`` files within your asset root(s). In
      theory, if you have the source data and the asset root ``.xml``
      files, everything else can be reconstructed. Google Earth
      Enterprise does not include any tools for doing such a
      reconstruction, but the data is there and it could be done, if
      necessary.

      You do not need to back up your publish root(s), since there is
      nothing there that cannot be recreated. If you have the space and
      want to back them up, however, recovery will be faster, but it is
      not necessary.

      Many Google Earth Enterprise users also back up their product
      files. These are the low-level files that result from building
      resources (for example, ``.kip``, ``.ktp``, ``.kmp``, ``.kvp``).
      That way, if you do need to reconstruct, you can import the
      product files (rather than raw source files) to recreate the
      resources. This will save you some build time.
