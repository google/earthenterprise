   .. container:: content

      The first step in preparing data is to define resources by
      importing the source data into Google Earth Enterprise Fusion. You
      import imagery, terrain, and vector data separately.

      This lesson guides you through defining and building imagery,
      terrain, and vector resources.

      .. _Define_Imagery_Resources:
      .. rubric:: Define Imagery Resources

      The following exercises guide you through exploring your source
      data and defining and building imagery resources. Resources
      comprise the most basic components of a Google Earth Enterprise
      Fusion database.

      .. _Explore_Imagery_Source_Files:
      .. rubric:: Explore Imagery Source Files

      In this exercise, you learn to use the Preview panes in the Google
      Earth Enterprise Fusion GUI to investigate imagery source files to
      be sure they cover the desired area before you import them into
      Google Earth Enterprise Fusion.

      The following limitations apply to previewing data.

      -  Certain display rule settings are ignored:

         -  Simplification method
         -  Suppress duplicates
         -  Elevation/height
         -  Highlight style
         -  Road label
         -  Road shield

      -  Lines and polygons are drawn as lines only (not filled), so use
         Line Color or Outline Color to see the colors of
         lines or polygons in the Preview pane.
      -  Labels appear in the assigned color, but scaling and centering
         are ignored for labels.
      -  Icons do appear in the Preview pane, but any style settings
         (color, scale) are ignored.
      -  Icons are not selectable, and their pop-up text is not
         displayed.

      .. rubric:: To explore imagery source files:
         :name: to-explore-imagery-source-files

      #. Click the **Open** |Open Icon| icon:.
      #. Select
         ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion/Imagery/usgsLanSat.tif``
         and click **Open**.

         The image name appears in the Preview List pane. This is called
         a *layer* (an individual source file or resource).

         |Layer in the Preview List|

      #. Select the layer's checkbox.

         A bounding box in the Preview pane indicates the extent of the
         imagery in the selected file.

         |Bounding Box in the Preview pane|

      #. Right-click the layer in the Preview List pane, and select
         **Zoom to Layer** from the context menu.

         The Preview pane zooms to show only the region in the selected
         imagery file.

         |Preview Pane Zoom|

      #. Repeat the steps above, this time opening the
         **i3SF15-meter.tif** file.

         When you select the checkbox next to this second layer, a
         bounding box indicates the extent of the second layer within
         the first layer. You can see the relationship of each area to
         the other in the Preview pane.

         |Second Bounding Box in the Preview pane|

      #. When you finish viewing the imagery layers, right-click either
         layer in the Preview List pane, and select **Remove All
         Layers** from the context menu.

         A message prompts you to confirm that you want to remove all
         layers from the Preview panes.

      #. Click the **OK** button.
      #. Press **Ctrl+R** to reset the view to the whole Earth.

      .. _Define_Imagery_resources_2:
      .. rubric:: Define Imagery Resources

      In this exercise, you create imagery resources from the imagery
      data provided for this tutorial.

      .. rubric:: To define an imagery resource:
         :name: to-define-an-imagery-resource

      #. Select **Tools > Asset Manager**.
      #. In the Asset Manager, click |Imagery Resource Icon| in the
         toolbar. The Imagery Resource window appears.

         |Imagery Resource Window|

      #. Set the **Acquisition Date** to todayâ€™s date. This is required
         if you will be creating a historical imagery project later.

         The date you set for the imagery **Acquisition Date** is
         visible in the Google Earth Client when hovering the cursor
         over a tile. If you add this information to the imagery at a
         later point, a rebuild of the imagery project is required (as
         the date needs to be encoded in the JPEG tiles).

         When entering date information, the day or month values can be
         left blank. For example:

         -  ``2008-01-00`` indicates January 2008
         -  ``2008-00-00`` indicates 2008
         -  ``0000-00-00`` indicates undefined

         Leading zeros are not required when entering dates.

         .. note::

            **Note:** When you work with real data, the acquisition date
            should reflect the date the data was released. You can
            obtain this information from the provider. However, for the
            purpose of simplifying this tutorial, use the current date
            for all **Acquisition Date** fields.

      #. Select **NASA Imagery** from the **Provider** drop-down list.
         Notice that the Provider drop-down list contains all of the
         providers you added earlier.
      #. Set the **Mask Type** to **No Mask**.

         You are about to import the BlueMarble source data. Since that
         data covers the entire world, there is no need for a mask. That
         is, there is no fill data to mask out in the imagery.

      #. Click **Add**.

         The Open Source dialog opens to the
         ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion/Imagery`` folder.

         |Imagery Open Source Dialog|

      #. Select the ``bluemarble_4km.tif`` file, and click **Open**.
      #. Select **File > Save** and navigate to the
         ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Imagery`` folder you created in the
         previous chapter.
      #. Enter the name **BlueMarble** for the resource, and click
         **Save**.

      .. note::

         | **Notes:** Your system administrator should have configured a
           tutorial environment for you to work on the tutorial lessons,
           keeping your practice data separate from your live production
           data. If you encounter an error message that tells you that a
           tutorial source file is not readable or you cannot save a
           resource, contact your system administrator or refer to the
           :doc:`Google Earth Enterprise Administration Guide <6028272>` and
           configure the tutorial environment yourself before saving any
           practice data.
         | When you finish using any of the asset editors (such as the
           Imagery Resource Editor used in this exercise), you can
           either leave it open and move it to the side or close it.
           Generally, if you know you have more work to do on a given
           asset, you can leave the editor open. If you know you are done
           with an asset for now, you can close it and get it out of the
           way.

      .. container:: alert

         **Caution:** When you are defining assets for your live
         production system, it is important to remember that you cannot
         delete or edit asset names after you save them.

      In the Asset Manager, the name of the resource appears on the
      right when you select the
      ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Imagery``\ folder in the asset navigation
      tree.

      |Resource Name in the Asset Manager|

      .. _Build_Imagery_Resource:
      .. rubric:: Build an Imagery Resource

      Before you can view the imagery resource in the Preview pane or
      include it in a project, you must build it. You do not have to
      build each resource right away, however. You can define several
      resources and then build them all at the same time, if you prefer.
      There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. You can
      develop your own routine as you get more comfortable with Google
      Earth Enterprise Fusion.

      In this exercise, you will build the first resource right away.

      .. rubric:: To build an imagery resource:
         :name: to-build-an-imagery-resource

      #. In the Asset Manager, select the
         ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Imagery`` folder.

         **BlueMarble** appears on the right with **Current
         Version** and  **Current State** set to **None**, indicating
         that the resource has not yet been built.

      #. Right-click **BlueMarble**, and select **Build** from the
         context menu. The status of the resource immediately changes to
         **Queued** and then to **In Progress**.

         .. note::

            **Note:** Because imagery files are data-intensive, it can
            take some time to build imagery resources.

      #. Double-click the **Current Version** or **Current State**
         column for the resource to view the progress of the build.
      #. Right-click **BlueMarble**, and select **Current Version
         Properties**.

         The **Version Properties** dialog displays the most recent
         version of that resource. You can expand the version tree to
         view the status of the build in real time by clicking the **+**
         signs.

      #. When you are done reviewing the information in the **Version
         Properties** dialog, close that window.

      When the BlueMarble resource finishes building, its **Current
      State** column in the Asset Manager changes to **Succeeded**, and
      its **Current Version** column changes to the date and time the
      most recent build was started.

      .. _Define_Build_Remaining_Imagery_Resources:
      .. rubric:: Define and Build the Remaining Imagery Resources

      Now that you have defined and built one imagery resource, you can
      define and build the remaining imagery resources provided for this
      tutorial:

      While the resources are building, the Asset Manager list looks
      something like this:

      |Asset Manager While Resources are Building|
      It could take several minutes to build all of the imagery
      resources. When the builds are all complete, it looks like this:

      |Asset Manager When Builds are Complete|

      .. _Preview_Imagery_Resources:
      .. rubric:: Preview the Imagery Resources

      After you successfully build the imagery resources, you can view
      some of them in the Preview pane of the Google Earth Enterprise
      Fusion GUI.

      .. rubric:: To preview imagery resources:
         :name: to-preview-imagery-resources

      #. In the Asset Manager, drag and drop the **SFHighResInset**
         resource from the Asset Name column onto the Preview List pane.
      #. Drag and drop the **SFBayAreaLanSat** resource onto the Preview
         List pane, and then close the Asset Manager.

         .. note::

            **Note:** Google Earth Enterprise Fusion displays the
            resources in the order in which they are listed in the
            Preview List pane with the last asset on the list at the
            bottom of the stack and the first asset on the list on top.
            In this case, the SFHighResInset resource provides much
            higher resolution imagery for a small area of the
            SFBayAreaLanSat resource, so you want SFHighResInset to
            appear on top.

      #. Check the box next to each resource in the Preview List pane to
         display the associated imagery.

         Bounding boxes appear where the imagery is located on the base
         imagery; however, they appear to be very small because the
         display level is so high.

      #. Right-click **SFBayAreaLanSat** in the Preview List pane, and
         select **Zoom to Layer** from the context menu.

         The Preview pane zooms to the outermost edges of the selected
         layer. Notice the bounding box for the other resource.

         |Zoom to Layer FLanSatLayer|

      #. Right-click **SFHighResInset** in the Preview List pane, and
         select **Zoom to Layer** from the context menu.

         The Preview pane zooms to the outermost edges of the selected
         layer.

         |Zoom to Layer SFHighResInset|

      #. To prepare for the next exercise, zoom out to a display level
         between 11 and 12 |Zoom Level 11.6| to view more of the San
         Francisco bay area, as shown in the following graphic.

         To zoom out, you can either select |Zoom Drag Mode Icon| and
         then click in the Preview pane and push the mouse away from
         you, or roll the mouse wheel away from you.

         |Zoom Out|

      .. _Define_Terrain_Resources_2:
      .. _Define_Terrain_Resources:
      .. rubric:: Define Terrain Resources

      Defining terrain resources is very similar to defining imagery
      resources. The following exercises guide you through defining and
      building terrain resources.

      .. _Explore_Terrain_Source_Files:
      .. rubric:: Explore Terrain Source Files

      As with imagery files, you can preview terrain source files to be
      sure they cover the correct area before you convert them to
      resources. Although you learned about previewing source files in a
      previous exercise, this exercise gives you an opportunity to learn
      about more about the preview tools.

      .. rubric:: To explore terrain source files:
         :name: to-explore-terrain-source-files

      #. Click |Open File Icon|.

         The Open dialog appears.

      #. Navigate to the ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion/Terrain``
         folder.
      #. Select ``SF_terrain.tif``, and click **Open**.

         |Open Terrain Preview|

         The new layer name appears in the Preview List pane unchecked.

         |Unchecked Terrain Preview|

      #. Select **Enable All Layers** from the **Edit** menu to check the
         boxes for all layers.

         A bounding box appears for the terrain layer.

      #. Zoom out a bit to see the entire bounding box.

         .. note::

            **Note:** The Preview pane displays a bounding box for
            terrain source data, not the actual terrain imagery. You
            must define and build terrain resources to be able to see a
            preview of the actual terrain.

         |Preview All Terrain|
      #. Right-click **SF_terrain**, and select **Zoom to Layer** from
         the context menu.

         This fills the Preview pane with the city of San Francisco. The
         high-resolution imagery inset, SFHighResInset, is still part of
         this view, and the SFBayAreaLanSat provides the background
         imagery.

         |Zoom In To Terrain|

      #. Use the toolbar buttons and/or your mouse wheel to zoom in and
         out to explore the terrain on the underlying imagery.
      #. Right-click any layer and select **Remove All Layers**.

         A message prompts you to confirm that you want to remove all
         layers.

      #. Click the **OK** button.

         All of the layers disappear from the Preview panes. You can
         leave the preview pane zoomed in to prepare for an upcoming
         exercise, even though the imagery is too close to make out any
         details at this point.

      .. rubric:: Define Terrain Resources
         :name: define-terrain-resources-1

      In this exercise, you create terrain resources from the terrain
      data provided for this tutorial.

      .. rubric:: To define a terrain resource:
         :name: to-define-a-terrain-resource

      #. Open the Asset Manager, and click |Terrain Resource Icon| on
         the toolbar.

         The Terrain Resource Editor appears.

      #. Set the acquisition date to todayâ€™s date in year-month-day
         format by clicking each section of the date and enter the
         values.
      #. Select **USGS Terrain** from the Provider drop-down list.
      #. Set the **Mask Type** (under **Mask Options**) to **Have Mask**.

         The mask file for your import must be located in the same
         folder as the source file, and the file name must match the
         name of the source file with ``-mask`` appended. For example,
         in the tutorial files provided, the source file is called
         ``gtopo30_4km.tif``, and its mask file is named
         ``gtopo30_4km-mask.tif``. Google Earth Enterprise Fusion
         automatically applies the mask file by reference to the source
         file.

         .. note::

            **Note:** You can use the **Have Mask** option for resources
            that contain one source file only.

      #. Accept the **Elevation Units** default, **Meters**.
      #. Click **Add**.

         The Open Source dialog opens to the
         ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion/Terrain`` folder.

      #. Select **gtopo30_4km.tif**, and click the **Open** button.

         |Open Terrain Resource|

         The selected file appears on the Source File(s) list.

      #. Select **Save** from the **File** menu.

         The Save dialog appears.

      #. Navigate to the ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Terrain`` folder you
         created in :doc:`4412441`.
      #. Enter the name **WorldTopography** for the resource, and click
         **Save**.
      #. Close the Terrain Resource Editor dialog.

         The name of the resource appears on the right when you select
         the ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Terrain``\ folder in the asset
         navigation tree in **Asset Manager**.

      .. rubric:: To define another terrain resource:
         :name: to-define-another-terrain-resource

      #. In the **Asset Manager**, click |Terrain Resource Icon| on the
         toolbar.

         The Terrain Resource Editor appears.

      #. Set the acquisition date to todayâ€™s date in year-month-day
         format by clicking each section of the date and entering the
         values.
      #. Select **USGS Terrain** from the **Provider** drop-down list.

         accept the default mask settings:

         -  Feather: **100**
         -  Hole Size: **0**
         -  NoData: **-99999:0**

         (For details about masking, see the **Mask Options** section in
         the **Defining Resources** chapter of the **Reference Guide**.)

      #. Accept the **Elevation Units** default, **Meters**.
      #. Click **Add**.

         The Open Source dialog appears.

      #. From the ``/opt/google/share/tutorials/fusion/Terrain`` folder,
         select **SF_terrain.tif**, and click **Open**.

         The selected file appears on the Source File(s) list.

      #. Select **Save** from the **File** menu.

         The Save dialog appears.

      #. Navigate to the ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Terrain`` folder you
         created in :doc:`4412441`.
      #. Enter the name **SFTerrain** for the resource, and click
         **Save**.
      #. Close the Terrain Resource Editor dialog.

         The name of the resource appears on the right when you select
         the ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Terrain``\ folder in the asset
         navigation tree in **Asset Manager**.

      .. _Build_Modify_Terrain_Resources:
      .. rubric:: Build and Modify Terrain Resources

      As with imagery resources, in this exercise, you will build the terrain
      resources right away.

      .. note::

         **Note:** The WorldTopography terrain resource is quite large
         and could take up to 30 minutes to build, depending on the
         speed of your CPU. It is a good idea to start this exercise
         close to lunch time or just before you attend a meeting, so it
         can build while you are busy doing something else.

      .. rubric:: To build and modify a terrain resource:
         :name: to-build-and-modify-a-terrain-resource

      #. In the Asset Manager, select the
         ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Terrain`` folder.

         The terrain resources appear on the right with the **Current
         Version** and the **Current State** set to **None**, indicating that
         the resources have not yet been built.

      #. Right-click **WorldTopography**, and select **Build** from the
         context menu.

         The status of the resource changes to **Queued** and then to
         **In Progress**.

      #. Right-click **SFTerrain**, and select **Build** from the
         context menu.

         The status of the SFTerrain resource changes to **Queued**
         until the WorldTopography resource finishes building and then
         changes to **In Progress**.

         When each resource finishes building, the **Current State** column
         in the Asset Manager changes to **Succeeded**, and its **Current
         Version** column changes to the date and time the most recent
         build was started.

         Drag the **SFTerrain** resource into the Preview List pane, and
         check the box next to it.

      #. Right-click **SFTerrain**, and select **Zoom to Layer**.

         The bounding box for the terrain resource appears in the
         Preview pane, and the grayscale terrain imagery appears in the
         bounding box.

         .. note::

            **Note:** Since the Preview pane in Google Earth Enterprise
            Fusion is meant for preview purposes only, it does not
            render terrain in 3D like Google Earth EC. Instead, it
            renders a grayscale interpretation of the terrain. The
            lighter pixels represent the higher elevations, and the
            darker pixels represent lower elevations. For this reason,
            the Preview pane is not useful for comparing elevation
            values from different resources.

         |image25|

         Because the background is a very low-resolution image, it is
         hard to determine what you are looking at. The solution to this
         problem is to add high-resolution imagery to the Preview pane
         to give you a frame of reference.

      #. In the Asset Manager, navigate to
         ``ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Imagery``, and drag **SFBayAreaLanSat**
         to the Preview List pane, and check the box next to it.

         The higher-resolution imagery appears under the terrain
         imagery, so you can get a better idea of where the terrain is
         located.

         The mask automatically generated by Google Earth Enterprise
         Fusion removes all of the fill data in the terrain resource,
         using the feather value specified in the Terrain Resource
         Editor.

         The preview shows that the default feather of 100 pixels is far
         too aggressive, removing much of the terrain data around the
         coastline. In a real-world situation, you can provide your own
         mask for the data to be sure you can see every detail around
         the coastline. For this tutorial, however, simply adjust the
         feather value for the mask that Google Earth Enterprise Fusion
         generates automatically.

      #. Double-click the for the **SFTerrain** resource in the Asset
         Manager.

         The Terrain Resource Editor appears with all of the SFTerrain
         resourceâ€™s settings.

      #. Change the **Feather** value to **5**.
      #. Select **Save** from the **File** menu.

         Google Earth Enterprise Fusion saves the terrain resource with
         the same name.

      #. Build the SFTerrain resource again.
      #. Drag and drop the **SFTerrain** resource onto the Preview List
         pane.

         The new version of the resource appears at the bottom of the
         list with a number after the resource name to distinguish it
         from other versions of the same resource.

      #. Uncheck the box next to the original version of the resource,
         and check the box next to the modified version.

         The Preview pane displays the modified version of the resource.

         Because the second version of the resource is listed below the
         imagery resource in the Preview List pane, it appears below the
         imagery in the Preview pane. Because of the list order, the
         imagery resource is actually obscuring the terrain resource.
         All you can see is the mask.

      #. Right-click any layer in the Preview List pane, and select
         **Remove All Layers** from the context menu.

         A message prompts you to confirm that you want to remove all
         layers.

      #. Click **OK**.

         All of the layers disappear from the Preview panes.

      #. In the Asset Manager, navigate to
         ``ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Terrain``, and drag and drop the new
         version of the **SFTerrain** resource onto the Preview List
         pane, and check the box next to it.
      #. Navigate to ``ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Imagery``, and drag
         **SFBayAreaLanSat** to the Preview List pane, and check the box
         next to it.

         Now you can see the preview of the terrain over the imagery.
         With a feather value of 5, the mask removes the fill data but
         removes much less of the real data, allowing the actual terrain
         data to be visible out to the edges of the coastline.

         |image26|

      #. When you finish examining the preview, right-click either layer
         in the Preview List pane, and select **Remove All Layers** from
         the context menu.

         A message prompts you to confirm that you want to remove all
         layers.

      #. Click **OK**.

         All of the layers disappear from the Preview panes.

      #. Press **Ctrl+R** to reset the view to the whole Earth.

      .. _Define_Vector_Resources:
      .. rubric:: Define Vector Resources

      The following exercises guide you through the process of defining
      and building a vector resource for California highway data.

      .. _Explore_Vector_Source_Files:
      .. rubric:: Explore Vector Source Files

      As with imagery and terrain files, you can preview vector source
      files to be sure they provide the data you want before you convert
      them to resources. This exercise provides an opportunity for you
      to use some additional preview tools.

      .. rubric:: To explore vector source files:
         :name: to-explore-vector-source-files

      #. Click |Open File Icon|.

         The Open dialog appears.

         List pane. Then, with |Select Mode Icon| selected on the
         toolbar, drag a selector rectangle around the City of San
         Francisco.

         The selected area is highlighted (yellow), and the data fields
         that correspond to the selected area appear in the Data List
         pane.

         You can scroll through this data and sort it by columns to
         explore the values of each field to determine the potential
         attributes to use in the filters you set up in :ref:`Configuring Display Rules <Configure_Display_Rules_for_a_Vector_Project>`.

      #. When you finish exploring the data, right-click the
         **california_roads_line**, and select **Remove Layer** to clear
         the Preview panes.

      #. Enter the name **CAHighways** for the resource, and click
         **Save**.
      #. Close the Vector Resource Editor dialog.

         The name of the resource appears on the right when you select
         the ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Vector``\ folder in the asset
         navigation tree in **Asset Manager**.

      .. _Build_Vector_Resource:
      .. rubric:: Build a Vector Resource

      As with the imagery and terrain resources, in this exercise, you
      will build the vector resource right away. In fact, you must build
      vector resources before you can include them in projects.

      .. rubric:: To build a vector resource:
         :name: to-build-a-vector-resource

      #. In the Asset Manager, select the
         ``/ASSET_ROOT/Resources/Vector`` folder.

         **CAHighways** appears on the right with the **Current Version**
         and the **Current State** set to **None**, indicating that the
         resource has not yet been built.

      #. Right-click **CAHighways**, and select **Build** from the
         context menu.

         The status of the resource changes to **Queued** and then to
         **In Progress**. When the CAHighways resource finishes
         building, its **Current State** column in the Asset Manager changes
         to **Succeeded**, and its **Current Version** column changes to the
         date and time the most recent build was started.

      .. rubric:: Define and Build the Remaining Vector Resources
         :name: define-and-build-the-remaining-vector-resources

      Now that you have defined and built one vector resource, you can
      define and build the remaining vector resources provided for this
      tutorial.

      Follow the steps in :ref:`Defining a Vector Resource <Define_a_Vector_Resource>` to
      define resources for the following vector source files:

      -  **CAPopPlaces**

         -  Acquisition Date: todayâ€™s date
         -  Provider: **USGS POIs**
         -  Source File: ``california_popplaces.csv``
         -  Name: **CA_POIs**

      -  **USCensusbyCounty**

         -  Acquisition Date: todayâ€™s date
         -  Provider: **GNIS/US Census Bureau**
         -  Source File: ``us_counties_census.shp``
         -  Name: **US_Population**

      After defining each resource, right-click it and select **Build**
      from the context menu. By the time you finish defining the last
      resource, the other builds should all be complete.

      When Google Earth Enterprise Fusion finishes building the last
      resource, close the Asset Manager by clicking the close box
      (**X**) in the top right corner, and go on to the :doc:`next
      lesson <4412421>`.
