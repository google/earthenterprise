      .. rubric:: View a globe in Google Earth EC

      Google Earth Enterprise Client lets you connect directly with
      your organizationâ€™s private globes. You can sign in to as many
      databases as you want.

      .. rubric:: To view a globe in Google Earth EC:

      #. Launch Google Earth EC. The Select Server dialog appears.
      #. Specify the **Publish point** by entering or selecting the URL
         or IP address of your server and database in the **Server** field.
         
         For example, a Publish point of **BayAreaHighways** would be
         hosted at http://\ *myserver.mydomainname.com*/BayAreaHighways,
         where *myserver* and *mydomainname* are specific to your
         server.
      
      #. Click the **Sign In** button.

         .. container:: alert

            If you have logged in to this server with Google Earth EC
            previously, log out, clear your cache, and log back in. For
            help with clearing your cache, see :doc:`6010060`.

      #. Google Earth EC displays your database. The Layers panel shows
         the terrain, imagery, and vector layers in the published
         database.

      .. rubric:: Viewing 3D databases in a browser

      You can view 3D globes from a browser using **Preview** if you
      have access to Google Earth Plugin and a supported browser.
      However, Google Earth Plugin is now deprecated and does not work
      in modern browsers that do not implement NPAPI.

      .. rubric:: To view your map database from Google Earth Enterprise
         Server:

      #. Log in to the Admin console of Google Earth Enterprise Server.
         The Admin console opens to the **Databases** page.
      #. Check the box next to the 3D database that you want to view.
      #. Click **Preview** or the **Publish point** of the database you
         selected. A new browser tab opens displaying your 3D database.
