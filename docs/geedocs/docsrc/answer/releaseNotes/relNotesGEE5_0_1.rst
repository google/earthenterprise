            Number

Description

Resolution

13010755

You can add the Google Base Map as imagery for map databases but viewing
a map database in a browser currently requires creating and editing a
copy of ``/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps_google.html``, one HTML file
for each map published.

| Fixed. No editing of
| ``maps_google.html`` required.
| Note that resolution allows using
| only Google Base Map or the Google Base Map *and*
| an imagery layer.
| See :ref:`Using Google Base Map. <../answer/4412455.html#GeoDatabase>`

14357181

When running the Cutter command, the Apache server connection may not
close correctly after the background process has completely executed,
leading to a build failure of the portable globe or map.

Fixed. The Apache server now closes the connection appropriately after
the cutting process has completed.

14105700

Portable globes and maps may become unregistered and unpublished from
GEE Server when the ``/globes`` directory becomes temporarily
unavailable.

Fixed. If you have registered and/or published portable files that are
no longer available in your ``/globes`` directory, use the
:ref:```geserveradmin --portable_cleanup`` <../answer/3481558.html>`
command to clean up portable globes registration information. The
cleanup unregisters/unpublishes portable globes or maps that have been
removed from your ``/globes`` directory.

11315730

Uninstalling GEE Fusion 5.x prevents GEE Server 5.x from running;
likewise uninstalling GEE Server 5.x prevents GEE Fusion 5.x from
running.

Fixed. Uninstalling either Fusion or GEE Server does not impact the
running of the remaining installed component. However, do make sure that
you continue to use the same release versions of Fusion and GEE Server
to avoid any compatibility issues.

13232808

Portable globes (``*.glc``) without a timestamp in the Manage portable
dialog may not be registered with GEE Server.

Fixed.

15274582

In rare circumstances, tiles may be missing from vector data in 2D
portable files.

Fixed.

14463855

GEE Server fails when publishing to different publish points that are
only distinguished by case, such as "Google" and "google."

Fixed. In GEE Server, when publishing a database or portable, the
publish point you specify is now case *insensitive*. Upper and lower
case are not differentiated. Make sure you specify unique publish point
path names.

3941714

The GLC assembly tool does not clean up files correctly after a composite
globe or map is created

Fixed.

13941482

The GLC assembly tool uses the ``/tmp/`` directory for composite globe
or map processing, which is frequently on a limited partition space.

| Fixed. GLC assembly now uses the
| ``/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs /cutter/globes /.globe_builder``
  directory for
| composite file processing, that is,
| the same volume as your Portable
| globes directory.

13931811

When deleting a layer and rebuilding a ``.glc``, sometimes the GLC
assembly tool does not appear to remove the layer.

Fixed.

13916427

The display of the build progress window of the GLC assembly tool is
delayed when clicking **Assemble Glc**.

Fixed.

13916422

The pan and zoom controls in the Cutter tool window are partially
obscured by the **Create new offline map** panel.

| Fixed. The pan and zoom controls
| are now hidden.

12239387

Historical imagery from 5.x-generated imagery projects display
incorrectly.

| Fixed.
| Support added for displaying
| historical imagery from 5.x
| -generated imagery projects. There
| is still one remaining issue which
| requires turning off historical
| imagery in order to see the most
| current database in the current
| version of Google Earth EC.
| See Known Issues.

13889571

When entering subsequent search parameters in a search tab in Google
Earth EC, search results from previous query parameters persist in
subsequent searches.

Fixed.

13584831

Search parameters that include quotes are not supported.

| the longitude will also work.
