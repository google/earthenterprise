-[ Error message ]-

"Unrecognized notify command: ValidateProtocolVersion"

-[ Description ]-

During the initial transition from tools that do not check for
matching versions to the versions that do check (for example, from
2.4.x to 3.x), you tried to use a later version of the Fusion GUI or
command line with a previous version of the system manager.

-[ Resolution ]-

Ensure that you are using the same version of Fusion and GEE Server.
