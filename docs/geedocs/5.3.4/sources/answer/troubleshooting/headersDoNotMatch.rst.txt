Headers do not match

-[ Error message ]-

"Headers do not match"

-[ Description ]-

The error appears in the vector Asset log when there is more than one
source file in the resource and their attributes are not exactly
identical. Either the labels are not the same, or one data file has an
attribute that the other is missing.

-[ Resolution ]-

Make the attribute labels match or, if one data set is lacking an
attribute, give it an empty column with the same attribute label.
