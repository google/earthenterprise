Release notes: Open GEE 5.2.1

-[ Overview ]-

Open GEE 5.2.1 is a comprehensive update of

Open GEE 5.2.0

. It contains new features, several bug fixes in Fusion and GEE
Server, and updates to third-party libraries.

-[ New Features ]-

MrSID support

. At build time, Open GEE checks for MrSID libraries and, if found,
Fusion will be built with MrSID raster format support.

RPM Installers

. For RedHat and CentOS, RPMs can now be built to enable easier
installation. For Ubuntu, the installer scripts continue to be the
supported way to install Open GEE.

JPEG2000 performance boost

. Updated version of OpenJpeg2000 library has considerable performance
increase.

Controlling quality of terrain

. Command-line tool gepackgen producing packets now accepts a
decimation value. In general, reducing the decimation value for
terrain produces higher quality and better looking terrain.

Testing scripts enhanced

. "publish_tutorial.sh" and "publish_historical.sh" scripts now
publish the pushed databases.

Detailed version info

. Version number displayed in user interface shows detailed
information indicating an official release or a development build.

Continuous Integration

. Travis CI is used for continuous integration. On every new commit to
Open GEE a build is executed to validate the committed changes.
