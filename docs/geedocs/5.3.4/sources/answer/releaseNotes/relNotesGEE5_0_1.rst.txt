-[ Known Issues ]-

      Number  Description  Workaround  12239387  For databases that
include historical imagery, if you turn on Historical imagery in
Google Earth EC and move the time slider to the current time, the most
recent database in your historical imagery does not display correctly.
When you move the time slider to view the current database, turn off
Historical imagery to display the database correctly.  14463855  In
GEE Server, when publishing a database or portable, the publish point
you specify is now case-insensitive. Upper and lower case are not
differentiated.  Specify unique publish point path names. If you have
already specified publish points that are distinguished only by case,
such as "Google" and "google," Unpublish, specify unique publish
points, then Publish again.  15221527  In GEE Server, when cutting a
globe or map, the Cancel operation does not stop all associated
processes.  Before you begin the cutting process, create a kill script
as follows:  > sudo vi /opt/google/bin/kill_uid  ps -eF | grep $1 |
grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9  > sudo chmod 755
/opt/google/bin/kill_uid  Start a cut. If you need to cancel it, do
the following steps:  Copy the uid from the script window. It will be
in the paths used in the commands and will look something like
14845_1401320450.614644.  Click the Cancel button.  Kill any cutting
processes on the server. For example: > sudo  /opt/google/bin/kill_uid
14845_1401320450.614644  Note Because you are stopping the cutting
process in the JavaScript, your script should only need to kill one
process, i.e., the last process that was started.  11736928  Terrain
copyright information listed in the Provider Manager does not display
on the published globe in Google Earth EC.  No workaround.  14291339
Hebrew label characters that read right to left, for example, "מִבְחָן"
get rendered in reverse, for example, "ןחָבְמִ". This issue only applies
to 2D databases.  This example can be resolved as follows: "מִבְחָ
ן".split("").reverse().join("")

-[ Resolved Issues ]-

      Number  Description  Resolution  13010755  You can add the
Google Base Map as imagery for map databases but viewing a map
database in a browser currently requires creating and editing a copy
of /opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/maps_google.html, one HTML file for each
map published.  Fixed. No editing of maps_google.html required. Note
that resolution allows using only Google Base Map or the Google Base
Map and an imagery layer. See i Using Google Base Map..  14357181
When running the Cutter command, the Apache server connection may not
close correctly after the background process has completely executed,
leading to a build failure of the portable globe or map.  Fixed. The
Apache server now closes the connection appropriately after the
cutting process has completed.  14105700  Portable globes and maps may
become unregistered and unpublished from GEE Server when the i /globes
directory becomes temporarily unavailable.  Fixed. If you have
registered and/or published portable files that are no longer
available in your /globes directory, use the geserveradmin
--portable_cleanup <../fusionAdministration/commandReference> command
to clean up portable globes registration information. The cleanup
unregisters/unpublishes portable globes or maps that have been removed
from your /globes directory.  11315730  Uninstalling GEE Fusion 5.x
prevents GEE Server 5.x  from running; likewise uninstalling GEE
Server 5.x prevents GEE Fusion 5.x from running.  Fixed. Uninstalling
either Fusion or GEE Server does not impact the running of the
remaining installed component. However, do make sure that you continue
to use the same release versions of Fusion and GEE Server to avoid any
compatibility issues.  13232808  Portable globes (*.glc) without a
timestamp in the Manage portable dialog may not be registered with GEE
Server.  Fixed.  15274582  In rare circumstances, tiles may be missing
from vector data in 2D portable files.  Fixed.  14463855  GEE Server
fails when publishing to different publish points that are only
distinguished by case, such as "Google" and "google."  Fixed. In GEE
Server, when publishing a database or portable, the publish point you
specify is now case-insensitive. Upper and lower case are not
differentiated. Make sure you specify unique publish point path names.
3941714  The GLC assembly tool doesn't clean up files correctly after
a composite globe or map is created.  Fixed.  13941482  The GLC
assembly tool uses the <code>/tmp/</code> directory for composite
globe or map processing, which is frequently on a limited partition
space.  Fixed. GLC assembly now uses the
/opt/google/gehttpd/htdocs/cutter/globes/.globe_builder directory for
composite file processing, i.e., the same volume as your Portable
globes directory.  13931811  When deleting a layer and rebuilding a
.glc, sometimes the GLC assembly tool does not appear to remove the
layer.  Fixed.  13916427  The display of the build progress window of
the GLC assembly tool is delayed when clicking Assemble Glc.  Fixed.
13916422  The pan and zoom controls in the Cutter tool window are
partially obscured by the Create new offline map panel.  Fixed. The
pan and zoom controls are now hidden.  12239387  Historical imagery
from 5.x-generated imagery projects display incorrectly.  Fixed.
Support added for displaying historical imagery from 5.x-generated
imagery projects. There is still one remaining issue which requires
turning off historical imagery in order to see the most current
database in the current version of Google Earth EC. See <a
href="#KnownIssues">Known Issues</a>.  13889571  When entering
subsequent search parameters in a search tab in Google Earth EC,
search results from previous query parameters persist in subsequent
searches.  Fixed.  13584831  Search parameters that include quotes are
not supported.  Fixed. Note that the comma delimiter cannot be quoted,
so the workaround is "38","-122.2", not "38, -122.2". Just quoting
either the latitude or the longitude will also work.  13498453  When
clicking on an item in search results in Google Earth EC that include
the FlyToSpot query parameter, a javascript error may occur.  Fixed.
13609551  The Push option available in the context menu when clicking
on a database asset that has no valid versions.  Fixed.  13680266
When clicking on a search result that returns a single item in Google
Earth EC, a javaScript error may occur.  Fixed. Limits the search
bounds when only one search result is returned and prevents the zoom
level from exceeding level 17 for 2D and 3D databases.  11352561
There is no option to set a suggestion for a top-level search,
typically POI search, in the <strong>Publish</strong> dialog.  Fixed.
Added a text field to set "suggestion" for top-level search to enable
override of default suggestion of "Point of interest", e.g., and
option to set it to an empty string.  1115030  Uninstalling Fusion or
Server from /opt/google/install fails with java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.
Fixed.  13459510  Publishing to the same target in GEE Server may
unpublish the database.  Fixed.  12362796  Databases may disappear
from GEE Server after non-use over a period of several days.  Fixed
12891539  Search service incorrectly handles UTF-8 encoding query for
2D maps.  Fixed.  12995368  Missing interface control for setting
<em>polygon resolution</em> in the GEE Server Cutter tool.  Fixed by
adding the Advanced option in the GEE Server Cutter tool to set the
polygon resolution. See Creating portable globes and maps.  12981516
Limited support of UTF-8 encoded queries for geplaces search.  Fixed.
Improved the support of UTF-8 encoded queries for geplaces search,
e.g., cities.  11715339  The Preview option in the GEE Server Admin
console Databases window fails to display any preview for Fusion 3D
databases.  Fixed /opt/google/gehttp/htdocs/earth/earth_local.html to
point to the correct publish point.  12671863  Support
flyToFirstElement as additional query parameter for the search
services. See Create Search tabs.  Fixed.  8115171  Document Unable to
make reservation error msg.  Fixed.  8114492  Document :Unable to find
a suitable resource provider error msg.  Fixed.  11051993  In certain
cases, if a globe is corrupt or permissions are incorrectly set, the
GEE Server will crash.  Fix returns more information about damaged
globes.  12371493  Some databases that were not successfully published
still appear in the GEE Server admin page.  Fix introduces better
error checking.  11435585  Changing the port of Earth Server breaks
GEE Server admin commands.  Fix adds port check to match Apache
server.  9765322  Vector polygons are rendered in the wrong location
in certain cases.  Fixed in the polygon pipeline.  7737928  Cannot
build the tutorial SF Terrain project without including
WorldTopography terrain resource.  Fixed.  11254639  KML template
should have no references to www.google.com.  Fixed.  11134962
Horizontal black lines appear at tile boundaries.  Fix in the imagery
processing pipeline.  11022364  Issues Installing 5.x on top of 4.4.
Fixed installer to improve upgrade process.  7442639  GEE supports
only one field per custom Search tab in EC 6.2 and later.  Fixed. The
5.0.1 release supports multiple fields in EC 6.2 and all later
versions. To include multiple Search tab fields for EC 6.2 or later
Go to GEE Server admin console at http://localhost/admin.  Click
Search tabs.  Click Create new.  Enter your first field definition,
then click Add field. You can add as many fields as you want.
