      .. rubric:: New Features

      **Documentation overhaul**. All documentation was migrated to
      Sphinx format, making it easier to edit and maintain. User
      documentation file names were also migrated from number-based naming
      convention to self-explanatory descriptive titles. New documentation
      format also offers a search capability that was not possible before.

      **KML validation in cutter**. Basic validation is now performed
      on KML that is pasted into the cutter tool.

      **Memory and performance improvements**. This version of Open GEE
      includes several optimizations for performance and memory utilization.

      **Multithreaded builds**. Parts of imagery project builds can now run
      on multiple threads. See :doc:`../fusionAdministration/confTaskRulesForFusionPerf`.

      **Improved resume operation**. The resume operation has been rewritten to
      improve performance. See :doc:`../fusionAdministration/confTaskRulesForFusionPerf`.

      **Specify cache sizes in bytes**. The sizes of the asset and asset version caches can
      now be specified in bytes. See :doc:`../fusionAdministration/confTaskRulesForFusionPerf`.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.3.2 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

      Ubuntu 14.04 will no longer be supported due to its recent end of life.

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.3.2 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.

      .. rubric:: Updated Libraries

      Open GEE 5.3.2 includes some library updates:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 15 15
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Library
           - Version
         * - Apache
           - 2.4
         * - PostgreSQL
           - 9.6.15
         * - PostGIS
           - 2.3.9

      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.3.2. Installing Open GEE 5.3.2 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.2.

         * - Number

           - Resolution
         * - 1132
           - GEE Server doesn't always determine the correct hostname
           - Updated the virtual hosts URL to use ``hostname`` if ``getfqdn()`` doesn't return a good hostname.
             Also added documentation for setting up the system to aid in avoiding this problem.
         * - 1281
           - Quitting 32-bit Windows portable server in Windows 7 via Internet Explorer does not work
           - IE appears to perform aggressive caching, which was preventing the GET request to cmd=quit
             from making it to the server. Changing the command to be a POST request prevents this.
         * - 1376
           - Portable Globe Cutter fails the last step when using HTTPS
           - Used the advanced configuration to set a URL that will be used when cutter tries to make an openurl call.

           - System Manager crash
           - Fixed the crash's underlying cause.
         * - 1401
           - No notification when System Manager Asset Cache size is exceeded causing performance issues
           - Added a logging record when System Manager Asset Cache size is exceeded.
         * - 1404
           - WMS fails when using HTTPS
           - Skipped the internal Certificate Verification.
         * - 1420
           - Build should honor JAVA_HOME when creating rpm packages
           - Honored JAVA_HOME
         * - 1447
           - Compiling error when using scons cache
           - Fixed compiling error when using scons cache
