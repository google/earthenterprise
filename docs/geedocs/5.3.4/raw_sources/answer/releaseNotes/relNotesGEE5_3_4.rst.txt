      .. rubric:: New Features

      **Optimized handling of status updates for Canceled and Failed tasks**.
      System manager's algorithm for handling updates for Canceled and Failed
      tasks has been modified to use less memory. This change is experimental
      and can be enabled using the :ref:`GraphOperations flag <graph-operations>`.

      **Option to retry failed tasks**.
      Users can now configure Fusion to
      :ref:`retry tasks that fail <retry-failed-tasks>`, which allows
      Fusion to recover from intermittent failures.

      **Option to limit cache pruning**.
      Users can now limit how often the asset and asset version caches are pruned
      by use of an experimental option, :ref:`PrunePercent <prune-percent>`.

      .. rubric:: Supported Platforms

      The Open GEE 5.3.4 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the
      following operating systems:

      -  Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the
         most recent security patches
      -  CentOS 6.x and 7.x
      -  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

      Google Earth Enterprise 5.3.4 is compatible with Google Earth
      Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.


      To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend
      that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE
      5.3.2. Installing Open GEE 5.3.4 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will
      ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded
      correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.4.
