      .. rubric:: Description

      There is a special character in the name of a resource, project, or
      database. Special characters are not allowed in asset names.
      Special characters are:

      @ # $ % ^ & \* ' " > <

      .. rubric:: Resolution

      #. Remove the resource from the project.
      #. Hide the resource in the asset manager.
      #. Build a new resource with the source imagery and name it
         without special characters. Version 3.2 and later will check
         for special characters when saving the resource.
      #. Add the new resource to the project and rebuild the database.
