<h2>Release notes: Open GEE 5.2.5</h2>

  <h5>
    <p id="overview_5.2.5">New Features</p>
  </h5>
    <p><strong>When a GEE server is queried for server definitions, the response can be returned in valid JSON format.</strong> The <code>v</code> parameter can be added to the query string to specify which version of the API to use. The options are <code>v=1</code> and <code>v=2</code>. Version <code>1</code> returns data in the current format. Version <code>2</code> returns valid JSON data. An example URL that returns data in JSON format is: <code>http://&lt;GEE earth server&gt;/&lt;database_publish_point&gt;/query?request=Json&amp;v=2</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Additional options when publishing from the command line.</strong> Users can now enable POI search, enhanced search, and WMS when publishing from the command line.
    <p><strong>Portable globe packet dumps</strong>.
        <code>geglxinfo</code> is now capable of extracting packets from 3D portable globes.
        This is useful for exploring the contents of a 3D portable file.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Continue past empty levels.</strong>
      Cutter has a new advanced option when cutting from a 2D map.  The "Continue past empty levels"
      option forces Cutter to continue building the portable file in the polygon region down to the region level even if
      the GEE server thinks there is no imagery to display at intermediate zoom levels.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Installation scripts are disabled when Open GEE packages are installed.</strong>  The install and uninstall scripts will now check if Open GEE has been installed with a package manager before installation begins, and will not make any changes when the packages are installed.
    </p>
  <h5>
    <p id="supported_5.2.5">Supported Platforms</p>
  </h5>
  <p>The Open GEE 5.2.5 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the following operating systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the most recent security patches</li>
      <li>CentOS 6.x and 7.x</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Earth Enterprise 5.2.5 is compatible with Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.</p>
    <p><p>To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.2.5. Installing Open GEE 5.2.5 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.2.5.</p></p>

            <td>
              The System V init script has been migrated to using platform-specific utilities for
              starting and stopping daemons (Damonize on Red Hat, <code>start-stop-daemon</code>
              on Debian platforms).  Those handle daemon states correctly.  The
              <code>gestartdaemon</code> and <code>gestopdaemon</code> utilities have been removed.

              The portable server builds fail because they are looking for
              <code>earth_enterprise/src/version.txt</code> generated by the full earthenterprise build.
              As a consequence, portable server cannot be build on Windows without manually creating
              the missing file.

              If a 2D map contains imagery at resolution level 24 and Cutter tries to create a portable
              map with a region level of 24 the resulting portable map will now contain the high

            <td><code>genewmapdatabase</code> now looks for flat imagery projects as well as 
               Mercator imagery projects when adding imagery projects to Mercator databases. 
               Mercator imagery projects are given priority over flat imagery projects in the 
               case of a naming collision. Flat databases can still only use flat imagery 
               projects.</td>
