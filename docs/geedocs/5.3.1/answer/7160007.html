<h2>Release notes: Open GEE 5.3.0</h2>

  <h5>
    <p id="overview_5.3.0">New Features</p>
  </h5>
    <p><strong>Added the ability to control the XML cache size. </strong>
      The size can be modified by configuring the <code>INIT_HEAP_SIZE</code>, <code>MAX_HEAP_SIZE</code>, and <code>BLOCK_SIZE</code> settings in
    <code>/etc/opt/google/XMLparams</code>. This file must be created manually. View the <a href="../answer/176738.html">Configure Fusion performance</a> document for more details.</p>
    <p><strong>Users can now force the XML cache to purge periodically. </strong>
      This can be done by configuring the <code>PURGE</code> and <code>PURGE_LEVEL</code> settings in <code>/etc/opt/google/XMLparams</code>. 
      This file must be created manually. View the <a href="../answer/176738.html">Configure Fusion performance</a> document for more details.</p>
    <p><strong>Added a <code>long_version</code> parameter to the SCons build. </strong>This will allow the user to override the long version string.</p>

<p><strong>Added options to the Server install script.</strong>
       The server install script now checks the size of the publish root and allows the user to set custom user and group names.
</p>

<p><strong>Improved system manager performance and memory consumption for large builds.</strong> This release eliminates some duplicate processing and storage in system manager, which reduces the amount of time and memory it takes to run operations on large builds.</p>

<p><strong>Upgraded to OpenJPEG 2000 2.3.1.</strong> This upgrade brings bugs fixes and improvements.</p>

  <h5>
    <p id="supported_5.3.0">Supported Platforms</p>
  </h5>
  <p>The Open GEE 5.3.0 release is supported on 64-bit versions of the following operating systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 6.x and 7.x, including the most recent security patches</li>
      <li>CentOS 6.x and 7.x</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google Earth Enterprise 5.3.0 is compatible with Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) version 7.1.5 and above.</p>
    <p><p>To upgrade from Open GEE 5.2.0, do NOT uninstall it. We recommend that you upgrade Open GEE 5.2.0 by simply installing Open GEE 5.3.0. Installing Open GEE 5.3.0 on top of Open GEE 5.2.0 will ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are backed up and upgraded correctly to the new PostgreSQL version used by Open GEE 5.3.0.</p></p>
