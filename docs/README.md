**Earth Enterprise** is the open source release of Google Earth Enterprise, a
geospatial application which provides the ability to build and host custom 3D
globes and 2D maps.  Earth Enterprise does not provide a private version of
Google imagery that's currently available in Google Maps or Earth.

The application suite consists of three core components:

* Fusion - imports and processes imagery, vector and terrain source data
* Server - Apache or Tornado-based server which hosts the private globes built
  by Fusion
* Client - the Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and Google Maps Javascript
  API V3 used to view 3D globes and 2D maps, respectively.

### Installation

Earth Enterprise Fusion & Server currently run on 64-bit versions of the
following operating systems:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 6.0 to 7.2, including the most recent
  security patches
* CentOS 6.0 to 7.2
* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 14.04 LTS

Refer to the wiki for instructions on building from source.
