# Earth Enterprise [![Chat on Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20slack-ff69b4.svg)](http://slack.opengee.org)

Earth Enterprise is the open source release of Google Earth Enterprise, a geospatial application which provides the ability to build and host custom 3D globes and 2D maps.  Earth Enterprise does not provide a private version of Google imagery that's currently available in Google Maps or Earth.

The application suite consists of three core components:
* Fusion - imports and 'fuses' imagery, vector and terrain source data in to a single flyable 3D globe or 2D map.
* Server - Apache or Tornado-based server which hosts the private globes built by Fusion.
* Client - the Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and Google Maps Javascript API V3 used to view 3D globes and 2D maps, respectively.
