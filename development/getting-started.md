Earth Enterprise is the open source release of Google Earth Enterprise, a geospatial application which provides the ability to build and host custom 3D globes and 2D maps. Earth Enterprise does not provide a private version of Google imagery that's currently available in Google Maps or Earth.

The application suite consists of three core components:

`Fusion` - Imports and processes imagery, vector and terrain source data

`Server` - Apache or Tornado-based server which hosts the private globes built by Fusion

`Portable` - A disconnected globe that allows you to access your data in a local-server configuration

`Client` - The Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and Google Maps Javascript API V3 used to view 3D globes and 2D maps, respectively.

For more information, including how to build Google Earth Enterprise, see our Github page [here](https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/wiki).
